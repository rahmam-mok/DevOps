Below is an example of how you might structure your Terraform configuration to retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault and upload the `dev.properties` file to an AWS S3 bucket.

### Terraform Configuration (`main.tf`):

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "your-region"
}

provider "vault" {
  address = "http://your-vault-address:8200"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "your-s3-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
}

data "vault_generic_secret" "dev_properties" {
  path = "secret/path/to/dev.properties"
}

resource "local_file" "dev_properties_file" {
  content  = data.vault_generic_secret.dev_properties.data["content"]
  filename = "dev.properties"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "dev_properties_object" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.bucket
  key    = "path/in/s3/dev.properties"
  source = local_file.dev_properties_file.filename
  acl    = "private"
}
```

This Terraform configuration defines an AWS S3 bucket, retrieves the secret from Vault, and uploads the `dev.properties` file to the specified path in the S3 bucket.

Make sure to replace placeholder values like `"your-region"`, `"your-vault-address"`, `"your-s3-bucket"`, and `"secret/path/to/dev.properties"` with your actual configurations.

Remember to authenticate Terraform to Vault using the appropriate authentication method, such as AppRole, AWS IAM, or others, depending on your Vault setup. Adjust the Vault provider configuration accordingly.

After creating the Terraform configuration, you can run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to apply the changes.

Note: Ensure that Terraform has the necessary permissions to interact with AWS S3 and that the Vault server is accessible from the machine where Terraform is executed.
