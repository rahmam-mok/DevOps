Certainly! Below is an example Terraform script that creates an Amazon Cognito User Pool, sets a password policy requiring 12 digits, and adds tags to the User Pool:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_cognito_user_pool" "example" {
  name = "example-user-pool"
  alias_attributes = ["email"]
  username_attributes = ["email"]
  auto_verified_attributes = ["email"]
  schema {
    attribute_data_type = "String"
    name               = "email"
    required           = true
  }
  password_policy {
    minimum_length    = 12
    require_lowercase = false
    require_numbers   = true
    require_symbols   = false
    require_uppercase = false
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleUserPool"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "user_pool_id" {
  value = aws_cognito_user_pool.example.id
}
```

In this script:

1. We specify the AWS provider with your desired region.
2. We create a Cognito User Pool named "example-user-pool".
3. We define the user pool attributes, including the "email" attribute as a required string.
4. We set the password policy to require a minimum length of 12 characters and at least one number.
5. We add tags to the User Pool, which you can customize as needed.

Make sure to replace the AWS region and other details as per your requirements. You can use the `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` commands to initialize, plan, and apply this Terraform configuration.
