To create an SNS topic and set up CloudWatch alerts for SSL certificate expiration for certificates imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) using Terraform, you can follow these steps. Make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions for ACM, CloudWatch, and SNS.

1. Create an SNS topic in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "ssl_certificate_expiration_topic" {
  name = "SSL_Certificate_Expiration_Topic"
}
```

2. Create an IAM policy for your CloudWatch alarms. You can define a policy like this:

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "cloudwatch_sns_policy" {
  statement {
    actions   = ["sns:Publish"]
    resources = [aws_sns_topic.ssl_certificate_expiration_topic.arn]
  }
}
```

3. Create an IAM role that allows CloudWatch alarms to publish to the SNS topic:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "cloudwatch_sns_role" {
  name = "CloudWatchSNSTopicRole"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
      Effect = "Allow",
      Principal = {
        Service = "cloudwatch.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "cloudwatch_sns" {
  name   = "CloudWatchSNSTopicPolicy"
  description = "Policy to allow CloudWatch to publish to SNS topic"
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.cloudwatch_sns_policy.json
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "cloudwatch_sns_attachment" {
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.cloudwatch_sns.arn
  role       = aws_iam_role.cloudwatch_sns_role.name
}
```

4. Create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors SSL certificate expiration and uses the SNS topic for notifications. Replace `"YourCertificateArnHere"` with the ARN of your ACM certificate:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "ssl_certificate_expiration_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "SSL_Certificate_Expiration_Alarm"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods = 1
  metric_name         = "RemainingDays"
  namespace           = "AWS/ACM"
  period              = 3600
  statistic           = "Minimum"
  threshold           = 30
  alarm_description   = "SSL Certificate will expire within 30 days."
  alarm_action {
    type              = "arn"
    target_arn        = aws_sns_topic.ssl_certificate_expiration_topic.arn
  }
  dimensions = {
    CertificateArn = "YourCertificateArnHere" # Replace with your certificate's ARN
  }
}
```

5. Replace `"YourCertificateArnHere"` with the ARN of your ACM certificate in the `CertificateArn` dimension.

6. Finally, run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create the SNS topic, IAM role, IAM policy, and CloudWatch alarm. This configuration will create a CloudWatch alarm that sends notifications to the SNS topic when the SSL certificate is about to expire. You can adjust the threshold and other parameters as needed.
