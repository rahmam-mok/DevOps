1. **Create a Volume from the Snapshot**
2. **Stop the EC2 Instance**
3. **Detach the Existing Root Volume**
4. **Attach the New Volume as the Root Volume**
5. **Start the EC2 Instance**

Below is a Terraform script outline that demonstrates these steps. Adjust the specifics (e.g., instance IDs, snapshot IDs, region, etc.) as necessary.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "your-region"
}

# Data source to fetch the existing EC2 instance
data "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_id = "i-yourinstanceid"
}

# Create a volume from the snapshot
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "from_snapshot" {
  snapshot_id = "snap-your_snapshot_id"
  availability_zone = data.aws_instance.example.availability_zone
  volume_type       = "gp2"  # Adjust the volume type as needed
  tags = {
    Name = "volume-from-snapshot"
  }
}

# Stop the instance
resource "aws_instance" "example_stop" {
  instance_id = data.aws_instance.example.instance_id
  instance_state = "stopped"
  depends_on = [aws_ebs_volume.from_snapshot]
}

# Detach the existing root volume
resource "aws_volume_attachment" "detach_root" {
  device_name = data.aws_instance.example.root_device_name
  volume_id   = data.aws_instance.example.root_block_device.volume_id
  instance_id = data.aws_instance.example.instance_id
  force_detach = true
  depends_on = [aws_instance.example_stop]
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

# Attach the new volume as the root volume
resource "aws_volume_attachment" "attach_new_root" {
  device_name = data.aws_instance.example.root_device_name
  volume_id   = aws_ebs_volume.from_snapshot.id
  instance_id = data.aws_instance.example.instance_id
  depends_on = [aws_volume_attachment.detach_root]
}

# Start the instance
resource "aws_instance" "example_start" {
  instance_id = data.aws_instance.example.instance_id
  instance_state = "running"
  depends_on = [aws_volume_attachment.attach_new_root]
}
```

### Steps Explanation:

1. **Create a Volume from the Snapshot**: `aws_ebs_volume` resource creates a new volume using the specified snapshot.

2. **Stop the EC2 Instance**: The `aws_instance` resource with `instance_state = "stopped"` ensures the instance is stopped before detaching and attaching volumes.

3. **Detach the Existing Root Volume**: The `aws_volume_attachment` resource detaches the current root volume from the EC2 instance.

4. **Attach the New Volume as the Root Volume**: Another `aws_volume_attachment` resource attaches the new volume created from the snapshot as the root volume.

5. **Start the EC2 Instance**: Finally, the `aws_instance` resource with `instance_state = "running"` starts the instance after the new root volume is attached.

Make sure to replace placeholder values (`your-region`, `i-yourinstanceid`, `snap-your_snapshot_id`) with actual values corresponding to your AWS environment.

### Note:
- Ensure that the EC2 instance ID, snapshot ID, and region are correctly specified.
- Make sure to have the necessary IAM permissions for creating, attaching, detaching, and stopping/starting instances.
- Terraform will manage the state of your infrastructure, so use the appropriate Terraform commands (`terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`) to execute these changes.
