Certainly! Below is an example Terraform script that creates an Amazon S3 bucket, creates subfolders inside the bucket, and tags the bucket:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Replace with your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "example-bucket-name"  # Replace with your desired bucket name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = "ExampleBucket"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "subfolder1" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  key    = "subfolder1/"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "subfolder2" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  key    = "subfolder2/"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket
}
```

In this script:

1. We specify the AWS provider with your desired region.
2. We create an S3 bucket named "example-bucket-name" (replace with your desired bucket name) with private ACL.
3. We add tags to the S3 bucket to provide metadata.

We create two subfolders inside the S3 bucket using `aws_s3_bucket_object` resources. You can customize the subfolder names and structure as needed.

Make sure to replace the bucket name, region, and other details as per your requirements. You can use the `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` commands to initialize, plan, and apply this Terraform configuration.
