To install PHP 7.4 with the PECL Redis extension on RHEL 8.8 using Ansible, you can modify the previous playbook to include the Redis extension installation. Here's an updated playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install PHP 7.4 with PECL Redis on RHEL 8.8
  hosts: your_target_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    - name: Install PHP 7.4 and required packages
      yum:
        name:
          - php74
          - php74-php-fpm
          - php74-php-cli
          - php74-php-common
          - php74-php-json
          - php74-php-mysqlnd
          - php74-php-opcache
          - php74-php-mbstring
          - php74-php-xml
        state: present

    - name: Set PHP 7.4 as the default PHP version
      alternatives:
        name: php
        path: /usr/bin/php74

    - name: Start and enable PHP-FPM
      systemd:
        name: php74-php-fpm
        enabled: yes
        state: started

    - name: Install PECL Redis extension
      command: pecl install redis
      args:
        creates: /usr/lib64/php/modules/redis.so

    - name: Add Redis extension configuration
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/php.d/40-redis.ini
        line: "extension=redis.so"
      notify:
        - Restart PHP-FPM

  handlers:
    - name: Restart PHP-FPM
      systemd:
        name: php74-php-fpm
        state: restarted
```

This playbook extends the previous one to include the installation of the PECL Redis extension. It does the following:

1. Installs the EPEL repository (if not already installed).
2. Installs PHP 7.4 and the required PHP packages, just like in the previous playbook.
3. Sets PHP 7.4 as the default PHP version.
4. Starts and enables PHP-FPM.
5. Installs the PECL Redis extension using the `pecl install` command.
6. Adds the configuration for the Redis extension to a PHP configuration file.
7. Notifies the "Restart PHP-FPM" handler to restart PHP-FPM after adding the extension.

Save this playbook to a file, for example, `install_php74_with_redis.yml`, and then run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_php74_with_redis.yml
```

Ensure you have Ansible installed and configured properly on your system and that you have the necessary privileges to become the root user or use `sudo` on the target server.
