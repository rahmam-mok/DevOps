---
- name: Install PHP 7.4 on RHEL 8
  hosts: your_host_name
  become: yes

  vars:
    php_version: "7.4"

  tasks:
    - name: Enable EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    - name: Install PHP packages
      yum:
        name: "php{{ php_version }}-{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - php
        - php-cli
        - php-common
        - php-devel
        - php-json
        - php-opcache
        - php-readline
        - php-xml

    - name: Install required dependencies
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - gcc
        - pcre-devel
        - zlib-devel



# In this updated playbook, the php_version variable is defined with a default value of "7.4". This variable can be modified to install a different PHP version if needed.

# Save the playbook in a file (e.g., install_php.yml) and run it using the ansible-playbook command:

# ansible-playbook install_php.yml --extra-vars "php_version=7.4"

# You can specify the desired PHP version using the --extra-vars flag when running the playbook. For example, to install PHP version 7.4, use --extra-vars "php_version=7.4". If you want to install a different PHP version, simply update the php_version value accordingly.

# Note that this playbook still includes enabling the EPEL repository and installing the required dependencies, as shown in the previous example.
