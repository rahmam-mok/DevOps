To install PHP 7.4 on RHEL 8.8 using Ansible, you can create an Ansible playbook. Here's an example playbook that does just that:

```yaml
---
- name: Install PHP 7.4 on RHEL 8.8
  hosts: your_target_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    - name: Install PHP 7.4 and required packages
      yum:
        name:
          - php74
          - php74-php-fpm
          - php74-php-cli
          - php74-php-common
          - php74-php-json
          - php74-php-mysqlnd
          - php74-php-opcache
          - php74-php-mbstring
          - php74-php-xml
        state: present

    - name: Set PHP 7.4 as the default PHP version
      alternatives:
        name: php
        path: /usr/bin/php74

    - name: Start and enable PHP-FPM
      systemd:
        name: php74-php-fpm
        enabled: yes
        state: started
```

Replace `your_target_server` with the hostname or IP address of the server where you want to install PHP 7.4. This playbook performs the following steps:

1. Installs the EPEL repository, which may be required for additional packages.
2. Installs PHP 7.4 and necessary PHP packages.
3. Sets PHP 7.4 as the default PHP version using the `alternatives` module.
4. Starts and enables the PHP-FPM service.

Save this playbook to a file, for example, `install_php74.yml`, and then run it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_php74.yml
```

Ensure you have Ansible installed and configured properly on your system and that you have the necessary privileges to become the root user or use `sudo` on the target server.
