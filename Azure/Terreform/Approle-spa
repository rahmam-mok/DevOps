Below is an example of how you can use Terraform to create a service principal, register an application, add four different app roles, choose "Single Page Application" as the platform, add redirect URIs, add secrets, and add Microsoft Graph permissions:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features = {}
}

resource "azurerm_ad_application" "pftt" {
  name                       = "pftt"
  application_type           = "spa"
  # other required properties...

  # Redirect URIs
  reply_urls = ["https://your-app-uri1", "https://your-app-uri2"]

  # Optional: Add app roles within the manifest block
  manifest = jsonencode({
    appRoles = [
      {
        allowedMemberTypes = ["User"],
        description        = "Role 1 description",
        displayName        = "Role 1",
        id                 = "1",
        isEnabled          = true,
        value              = "Role1",
      },
      {
        allowedMemberTypes = ["User"],
        description        = "Role 2 description",
        displayName        = "Role 2",
        id                 = "2",
        isEnabled          = true,
        value              = "Role2",
      },
      # Add two more roles following the same structure
    ],
  })
}

resource "azurerm_ad_service_principal" "pftc" {
  application_id = azurerm_ad_application.pftt.application_id
}

resource "azurerm_ad_service_principal_password" "pftc" {
  service_principal_id = azurerm_ad_service_principal.pftc.id
  value               = "your-secret-password"
  end_date            = "2025-01-01T01:02:03Z"  # Set your desired end date
}

# Optional: Assign these roles to users, groups, or service principals using azurerm_role_assignment

# Add Microsoft Graph permissions
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "graph_permissions" {
  name                       = "graph_permissions"
  # other required properties...

  # Required permissions to Microsoft Graph
  required_resource_access {
    resource_app_id = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000" # Microsoft Graph App ID
    resource_access {
      id   = "<Permission ID>"
      type = "Scope"
    }
    # Add more permissions as needed
  }
}
```

Replace `"https://your-app-uri1"` and `"https://your-app-uri2"` with your actual redirect URIs. Adjust other parameters, such as permissions and role details, based on your specific use case.

Note: You need to replace `"<Permission ID>"` with the actual permission ID from Microsoft Graph. Refer to Microsoft Graph documentation or use the Azure portal to find the correct IDs for the permissions you need.

Refer to the Terraform AzureRM provider documentation and Azure AD app registration documentation for more details.
