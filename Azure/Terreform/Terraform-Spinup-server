To spin up a server on Azure using Terraform, you'll need to create a Terraform configuration that defines the resources you want to provision, such as a virtual machine (server), network, and other necessary components. Here are the general steps to create an Azure virtual machine using Terraform:

1. **Install Terraform**:

   Ensure that you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Set Up Azure Credentials**:

   You need to configure your Azure credentials so that Terraform can interact with your Azure subscription. You can do this in one of two ways:

   - **Azure CLI**: If you have the Azure CLI installed, you can use the `az login` command to authenticate. This will configure Terraform to use your Azure credentials.

   - **Service Principal**: You can create a service principal in Azure and use its credentials for Terraform. This method is typically used in automated or CI/CD workflows. You'll need to provide the `client_id`, `client_secret`, `subscription_id`, and `tenant_id` in your Terraform configuration.

3. **Create a Terraform Configuration File**:

   Create a Terraform configuration file (commonly named with a `.tf` extension) that defines your Azure resources. Below is a simplified example of a Terraform configuration to create an Azure virtual machine:

   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }

   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
     name     = "example-resources"
     location = "East US"
   }

   resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
     name                = "example-network"
     address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
   }

   resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
     name                 = "example-subnet"
     resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
     address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
   }

   resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
     name                = "example-nic"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

     ip_configuration {
       name                          = "internal"
       subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id
       private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
     }
   }

   resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
     name                = "example-vm"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
     size                = "Standard_DS1_v2"
     admin_username      = "adminuser"
     admin_password      = "Password1234!"  # Replace with your own password

     os_disk {
       caching              = "ReadWrite"
       storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
     }

     source_image_reference {
       publisher = "Canonical"
       offer     = "UbuntuServer"
       sku       = "16.04-LTS"
       version   = "latest"
     }
   }
   ```

   Customize the values in this configuration to match your requirements. This example creates a simple Azure virtual machine with a Linux OS.

4. **Initialize Terraform**:

   Run the following commands in the directory where your Terraform configuration file is located:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Preview and Apply Changes**:

   Run a plan to preview the changes Terraform will make:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   If the plan looks good, apply it:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the changes when prompted.

6. **Destroy Resources (Optional)**:

   When you no longer need the resources, you can destroy them:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

This is a basic example of creating an Azure virtual machine with Terraform. You can extend this configuration to include other Azure resources like network security groups, load balancers, and more, depending on your requirements. Make sure to follow best practices for securely storing and managing sensitive data like passwords or secrets used in your Terraform configuration.

To spin up a server on Azure and tag all the resources properly using Terraform, you can follow these steps:

1. **Azure Provider Configuration**:

   In your Terraform configuration, you need to set up the Azure provider and configure your authentication. You can use Azure service principals for authentication.

   ```hcl
   provider "azurerm" {
     features {}
   }
   ```

   Configure your authentication either by providing the client_id, client_secret, and tenant_id directly in your configuration or by using environment variables or the Azure CLI.

2. **Resource Group**:

   Create a resource group where your resources will be deployed. You can also add tags to the resource group.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
     name     = "my-resource-group"
     location = "East US"

     tags = {
       environment = "production"
       project     = "my-project"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Virtual Network and Subnet**:

   Create a virtual network and subnet for your server. Add tags as needed.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
     name                = "my-virtual-network"
     address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

     tags = {
       environment = "production"
       project     = "my-project"
     }
   }

   resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
     name                 = "my-subnet"
     resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
     address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]

     tags = {
       environment = "production"
       project     = "my-project"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Network Interface and Server**:

   Create a network interface and a virtual machine (server) attached to the virtual network. Tag these resources as well.

   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
     name                = "my-nic"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

     tags = {
       environment = "production"
       project     = "my-project"
     }
   }

   resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
     name                = "my-vm"
     location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

     # Other VM configuration...

     network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]

     tags = {
       environment = "production"
       project     = "my-project"
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Plan and Apply**:

   Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory and then use `terraform plan` to see the execution plan. Finally, use `terraform apply` to create the resources with the specified tags.

6. **Destroy Resources (Optional)**:

   When you no longer need the resources, you can destroy them by running `terraform destroy`.

By tagging your resources properly in your Terraform configuration, you can better manage and identify your Azure resources based on their attributes and purposes. Make sure to follow Azure's best practices for tagging conventions and naming standards.
