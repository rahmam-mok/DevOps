To deploy two different pods for the same Java Spring Boot application, each running a different part of the application's process or functionalities in an AKS cluster, you can use Helm and Kubernetes. Here's a basic guide:

1. **Helm Chart Structure:**
   Organize your Helm chart directory with separate templates for each deployment and shared resources.

   ```
   myapp-chart/
   ├── charts/
   ├── templates/
   │   ├── deployment-part1.yaml
   │   ├── deployment-part2.yaml
   │   ├── service.yaml
   ├── values.yaml
   ├── Chart.yaml
   ```

2. **Define Deployments:**
   Create separate deployment YAML files (`deployment-part1.yaml` and `deployment-part2.yaml`) for each pod, specifying the relevant part of the application.

   ```yaml
   # deployment-part1.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-deployment-part1
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
           component: part1
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp-container
           image: your-image:tag
           args: ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar", "--part=part1"]
           # Add other container settings as needed
   ```

   ```yaml
   # deployment-part2.yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp-deployment-part2
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
           component: part2
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp-container
           image: your-image:tag
           args: ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar", "--part=part2"]
           # Add other container settings as needed
   ```

3. **Service Configuration:**
   Define a common service for both deployments in the `service.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   # service.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: myapp-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: myapp
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080 # Adjust as per your application's needs
   ```

4. **Values Configuration:**
   Customize your `values.yaml` file to allow flexibility in configuring parameters for each deployment.

   ```yaml
   # values.yaml
   deploymentPart1:
     image: your-image:tag
     # Add other parameters for deployment-part1

   deploymentPart2:
     image: your-image:tag
     # Add other parameters for deployment-part2
   ```

5. **Install the Helm Chart:**
   Install your Helm chart using the following command, providing the path to your chart directory:

   ```bash
   helm install myapp-release ./myapp-chart
   ```

   Ensure that your AKS cluster is properly configured.

This setup allows you to deploy two different pods for the same Java Spring Boot application, each running a different part of the application's process or functionalities. Adjust the YAML files according to your specific application and deployment requirements.



In the example YAML files provided, the `--part` argument is a placeholder for a custom command-line argument that you might want to pass to your Java Spring Boot application.

Specifically, in the context of the deployment YAML files:

- `args: ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar", "--part=part1"]` in `deployment-part1.yaml`
- `args: ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar", "--part=part2"]` in `deployment-part2.yaml`

Here, the `--part` argument is just an illustrative example. In a real-world scenario, you would replace `--part=part1` and `--part=part2` with the actual command-line arguments that your Spring Boot application expects.

For instance, if your Spring Boot application has custom functionality or components that can be controlled through command-line arguments, you would define and pass those arguments accordingly. The choice of the argument name (`--part` in this case) and its value depends on how your Spring Boot application is designed to interpret command-line inputs.

Make sure to adjust these arguments based on your specific application's requirements and how it processes command-line inputs during runtime.
