To add a user and group to an Azure service principal using Terraform, you'll first need to define the necessary resources in your Terraform configuration file. Here's a basic example:provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_ad_group" "example_group" {
  name        = "example-group"
  description = "Example Group"
}

resource "azurerm_ad_user" "example_user" {
  user_principal_name = "exampleuser@yourdomain.com"
  display_name       = "Example User"
  password           = "Password1234!"  # Password must meet Azure AD password complexity requirements
  force_password_change_on_login = true  # Optionally force password change on next login

  depends_on = [azurerm_ad_group.example_group]
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example_assignment" {
  scope              = azurerm_ad_group.example_group.id
  role_definition_id = data.azurerm_role_definition.contributor.id
  principal_id       = azurerm_ad_user.example_user.object_id
}

data "azurerm_role_definition" "contributor" {
  name = "Contributor"
}
This Terraform configuration creates:An Azure AD group (azurerm_ad_group) named "example-group".An Azure AD user (azurerm_ad_user) named "Example User" with the specified UPN and password.A role assignment (azurerm_role_assignment) granting the "Contributor" role to the user in the specified group.Ensure you have appropriate permissions to perform these operations, such as the Contributor role on the Azure subscription. Also, make sure to replace placeholder values like yourdomain.com with your actual domain, and adjust other parameters as needed for your specific use case.

To add an existing Azure AD group to a service principal using Terraform, you'll typically follow these steps:Define the Azure AD group as a data source in your Terraform configuration.Use the azurerm_role_assignment resource to assign the appropriate role to the service principal for the specified scope.Here's an example Terraform configuration:provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

data "azurerm_ad_group" "existing_group" {
  name = "existing-group-name"
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example_assignment" {
  scope              = data.azurerm_ad_group.existing_group.id
  role_definition_id = data.azurerm_role_definition.contributor.id
  principal_id       = "service_principal_object_id"
}

data "azurerm_role_definition" "contributor" {
  name = "Contributor"
}
In this example:data "azurerm_ad_group" "existing_group" defines a data source to represent the existing Azure AD group with the specified name.resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example_assignment" creates a role assignment, granting the "Contributor" role to the service principal at the scope of the existing Azure AD group.Replace "existing-group-name" with the name of your existing Azure AD group.Replace "service_principal_object_id" with the Object ID of the service principal to which you want to assign the role.Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations, such as the Owner or User Access Administrator role in Azure AD. Adjust the role and scope as needed for your specific requirements.
