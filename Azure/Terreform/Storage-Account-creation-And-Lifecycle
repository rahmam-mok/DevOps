Certainly! Below is a basic example of a Terraform script to set up an Azure Storage account and configure a lifecycle policy to move files from a folder to the Azure Cloud Storage:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features = {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resource-group"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestorageaccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "example" {
  name                  = "examplecontainer"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_management_policy" "example" {
  name                 = "example-policy"
  storage_account_id   = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  management_policy {
    rule {
      name = "move-to-cool-after-30-days"
      enabled = true
      type = "Lifecycle"
      definition {
        actions {
          base_blob {
            delete = "AfterThirtyDays"
          }
        }
        filter_blob_types = ["blockBlob"]
        definition {
          days_after_modification_greater_than = 30
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This script creates an Azure Resource Group, a Storage Account, a Storage Container, and configures a management policy for moving files to cool storage after 30 days. Make sure to adapt it according to your specific requirements and Azure environment.

Remember to authenticate Terraform with your Azure subscription using the necessary credentials or authentication method.
