To install the MongoDB BI Connector as a service on Amazon Linux, you can follow these steps:

1. **SSH into your Amazon Linux Instance:** Log in to your Amazon Linux instance using SSH. You'll need administrative privileges to install and configure services.

2. **Download the MongoDB BI Connector:**
   You can download the MongoDB BI Connector from the official MongoDB website. Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your system.

   ```bash
   wget https://info-mongodb-com.s3.amazonaws.com/mongodb-bi/v2/mongodb-bi-linux-x86_64-v2.x.y.tgz
   ```

   Replace `v2.x.y` with the actual version number.

3. **Extract the BI Connector:**
   Unpack the downloaded tarball:

   ```bash
   tar -zxvf mongodb-bi-linux-x86_64-v2.x.y.tgz
   ```

4. **Move the Connector to a Permanent Location:**
   You may want to move the extracted files to a more suitable location, like `/opt`.

   ```bash
   sudo mv mongodb-bi-linux-x86_64-v2.x.y /opt/mongodb-bi-connector
   ```

5. **Create a Configuration File:**
   Create a configuration file for the MongoDB BI Connector. You can use a text editor to create and edit the configuration file.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /opt/mongodb-bi-connector/mongodb-bi-connector.config
   ```

   Here's an example of a basic configuration file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   net:
      bindIp: 0.0.0.0
      port: 3307
   mongodb:
      mongodb_uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017"
   ```

   Modify the configuration to suit your specific needs.

6. **Create a Systemd Service Unit:**
   Create a systemd service unit file to manage the MongoDB BI Connector as a service.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/mongodb-bi-connector.service
   ```

   Add the following content to the service unit file:

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=MongoDB BI Connector

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/opt/mongodb-bi-connector/bin/mongodb-bi-connector -f /opt/mongodb-bi-connector/mongodb-bi-connector.config

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

7. **Reload systemd and Start the Service:**
   Reload systemd to detect the new service unit and start the MongoDB BI Connector service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start mongodb-bi-connector
   ```

8. **Enable the Service at Boot:**
   To ensure the MongoDB BI Connector starts automatically when the system reboots, enable it:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongodb-bi-connector
   ```

9. **Check the Service Status:**
   Confirm that the MongoDB BI Connector service is running without any issues:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongodb-bi-connector
   ```

That's it! You've successfully installed MongoDB BI Connector as a service on your Amazon Linux instance. You can now connect to it using the specified port (e.g., 3307) and configure it further as needed for your use case.
