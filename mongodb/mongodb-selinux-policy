To resolve MongoDB service blockage by SELinux using Ansible, you can create Ansible playbooks and roles to manage SELinux policies and MongoDB configurations. Here's a simplified example of Ansible tasks that you can use as a starting point:

1. Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., `mongodb_selinux.yml`) to orchestrate the tasks.

```yaml
---
- name: MongoDB SELinux Configuration
  hosts: mongodb_server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure SELinux is in permissive mode (temporary)
      selinux:
        policy: targeted
        state: permissive
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Ensure SELinux allows MongoDB to bind to network ports
      selinux_permissive:
        seuser: system_u
        serole: object_r
        setype: mongod_port_t
        selevel: s0
        allow: 1
      tags: mongodb_selinux

    - name: Ensure SELinux allows MongoDB to read/write data
      selinux_permissive:
        seuser: system_u
        serole: object_r
        setype: mongod_db_t
        selevel: s0
        allow: 1
      tags: mongodb_selinux

    # Add other MongoDB-specific SELinux configurations if needed

    - name: Restart MongoDB service
      service:
        name: mongod
        state: restarted
      tags: mongodb_service

    - name: Ensure SELinux is enforcing again (optional)
      selinux:
        policy: targeted
        state: enforcing
      ignore_errors: yes

- name: Ensure SELinux is enforcing (optional)
  hosts: mongodb_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure SELinux is enforcing
      selinux:
        policy: targeted
        state: enforcing
```

In this playbook:

- We set SELinux to permissive mode temporarily to identify and allow the necessary SELinux rules for MongoDB.
- We use the `selinux_permissive` Ansible module to add permissive rules for MongoDB, allowing it to bind to network ports (`mongod_port_t`) and read/write data (`mongod_db_t`).
- We restart the MongoDB service to apply the SELinux policy changes.
- Optionally, we ensure SELinux is set back to enforcing mode after making the necessary policy changes.

Remember to customize the playbook based on your specific MongoDB setup and SELinux requirements. You can run this playbook on your MongoDB server by specifying the inventory and other necessary configuration files.

Additionally, please exercise caution when modifying SELinux policies, as they impact system security. Ensure you understand the implications of the changes you make.
