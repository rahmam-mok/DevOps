To create a database on MongoDB Enterprise, along with different users and their access levels, you can modify the previous example playbook. Here's an updated version that includes an additional user with admin access:

```yaml
---
- name: Create MongoDB database and users
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars_files:
    - credentials.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Create MongoDB database
      community.mongodb.mongodb_db:
        name: "{{ mongodb_database }}"
        state: present

    - name: Create read-only MongoDB user
      community.mongodb.mongodb_user:
        username: "{{ mongodb_read_only_user }}"
        password: "{{ mongodb_read_only_password }}"
        database: "{{ mongodb_database }}"
        roles:
          - { role: read, db: "{{ mongodb_database }}" }
        state: present

    - name: Create read-write MongoDB user
      community.mongodb.mongodb_user:
        username: "{{ mongodb_read_write_user }}"
        password: "{{ mongodb_read_write_password }}"
        database: "{{ mongodb_database }}"
        roles:
          - { role: readWrite, db: "{{ mongodb_database }}" }
        state: present

    - name: Create admin MongoDB user
      community.mongodb.mongodb_user:
        username: "{{ mongodb_admin_user }}"
        password: "{{ mongodb_admin_password }}"
        database: admin
        roles:
          - { role: dbAdminAnyDatabase, db: admin }
        state: present
```

In this playbook, we've added a task to create an additional user with admin access using the `community.mongodb.mongodb_user` module. The `mongodb_admin_user` and `mongodb_admin_password` variables specify the credentials for the admin user.

Ensure that the `credentials.yml` file includes the necessary variables:

```yaml
---
mongodb_database: "mydatabase"
mongodb_read_only_user: "readonlyuser"
mongodb_read_only_password: "readonlypassword"
mongodb_read_write_user: "readwriteuser"
mongodb_read_write_password: "readwritepassword"
mongodb_admin_user: "adminuser"
mongodb_admin_password: "adminpassword"
```

Encrypt the `credentials.yml` file using `ansible-vault`:

```
ansible-vault encrypt credentials.yml
```

To run the playbook and provide the vault password, use the following command:

```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Remember to replace `playbook.yml` with the name of your playbook file.

This playbook will create a MongoDB database, along with a read-only user, a read-write user, and an admin user, using the provided credentials from the vault. The admin user will have admin access on the `admin` database. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and network access to interact with the MongoDB Enterprise instance. Adjust the playbook and variables as needed for your specific use case.
