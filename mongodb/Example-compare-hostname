Here's an example Ansible playbook that dynamically retrieves the hostname of five different servers and executes specific code if the last three characters of the hostname match a given string:

```yaml
---
- name: Dynamic Hostname Matching
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    target_string: "xyz"  # Change this to your desired string

  tasks:
    - name: Get hostname
      shell: hostname
      register: hostname_output

    - name: Extract last three characters of hostname
      set_fact:
        hostname_last_three: "{{ hostname_output.stdout[-3:] }}"

    - name: Execute specific code if hostname matches
      block:
        - name: Task to run if hostname matches
          debug:
            msg: "Hostname matches the target string"
        rescue:
          - name: Task to run if hostname does not match
            debug:
              msg: "Hostname does not match the target string"
```

In this playbook, we first use the `shell` module to retrieve the hostname of each server and store it in the `hostname_output` variable. Then, we use the `set_fact` module to extract the last three characters of the hostname and store them in the `hostname_last_three` variable.

Finally, we use a block structure to run specific code if the extracted last three characters of the hostname match the `target_string`. If the hostname matches, the specified task within the `block` section will be executed. If the hostname does not match, the specified task within the `rescue` section will be executed.

Make sure to update the `target_string` variable with your desired string to match against the hostname.
