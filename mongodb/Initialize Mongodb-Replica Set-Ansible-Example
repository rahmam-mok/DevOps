To initialize a MongoDB replica set using Ansible, you would need to create an Ansible playbook that performs the necessary steps. Below is an example of how you can achieve this. Note that this is a simplified example, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific environment and requirements.

1. **Create a Playbook**: Save the following Ansible playbook in a file, e.g., `mongodb_replicaset.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure MongoDB Replica Set and Create Admin User
  hosts: your_mongodb_servers  # Replace with the appropriate host group
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Initialize Replica Set
      mongodb_replicaset:
        members:
          - _id: 0
            host: hostname1:27030
            priority: 2
            votes: 1
          - _id: 1
            host: hostname2:27030
            priority: 1.5
            votes: 1
          - _id: 2
            host: hostname3:27030
            priority: 1
            votes: 1
          - _id: 3
            host: hostname4:27030
            arbiterOnly: true
            priority: 0
            votes: 0
        login_host: localhost
        login_port: 27030

    - name: Create Admin User
      mongodb_user:
        database: admin
        name: admin
        password: your_admin_password
        roles:
          - userAdminAnyDatabase
          - dbAdminAnyDatabase
          - clusterAdmin
        login_host: localhost
        login_port: 27030
        login_user: admin
        login_password: your_admin_password
```

2. **Run the Playbook**: Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mongodb_replicaset.yml
```

Make sure to replace the following placeholders:

- `your_mongodb_servers`: Replace with the name of the Ansible host group that includes your MongoDB servers.
- `hostname1`, `hostname2`, `hostname3`, `hostname4`: Replace with the actual hostnames of your servers.
- `your_admin_password`: Set a strong password for the admin user.

This example demonstrates initializing the replica set and creating an admin user. Adjust the playbook according to your specific requirements, including any additional configurations you need for your MongoDB deployment.

Please ensure that you have Ansible properly configured and that you've installed the necessary Ansible MongoDB collection or modules to execute these tasks. The above example assumes that you have the required Ansible modules available.
