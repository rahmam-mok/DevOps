Here's an example of an Ansible script to add the four members to a MongoDB replica set with the specified priorities and votes:

```yaml
---
- name: Add MongoDB replica set members
  hosts: mongodb_primary
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Configure replica set
      command: mongo --eval 'rs.reconfig({ "_id": "myReplicaSet", "members": [
        { "_id": 0, "host": "first_member:27017", "priority": 2, "votes": 1 },
        { "_id": 1, "host": "second_member:27017", "priority": 1.5, "votes": 1 },
        { "_id": 2, "host": "third_member:27017", "priority": 1, "votes": 1 },
        { "_id": 3, "host": "fourth_member:27017", "priority": 0, "votes": 0, "arbiterOnly": true }
      ]})'
```

In this script, replace "first_member," "second_member," "third_member," and "fourth_member" with the appropriate hostnames or IP addresses of the respective MongoDB replica set members.

Ensure that you have proper SSH access and Ansible configuration to execute this playbook against the MongoDB primary node. Modify the playbook accordingly if needed, based on your Ansible setup.

Please note that the above script assumes you have a MongoDB replica set already set up, and you are running the playbook from the primary node. Adjust the parameters as required for your specific environment.
