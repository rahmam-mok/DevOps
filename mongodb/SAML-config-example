To configure MongoDB Atlas with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for SAML authentication and role mapping, you need to set up both platforms and map users to MongoDB roles. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Configure Microsoft Entra ID for MongoDB Atlas
	1.	Sign in to Microsoft Entra Admin Center:
Go to the Microsoft Entra Admin Center and sign in.
	2.	Register the MongoDB Atlas Application:
	•	Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications > New Application.
	•	Search for “MongoDB Atlas” or choose Non-gallery application to create a custom SAML integration.
	•	Name the application (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) and create it.
	3.	Configure SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO):
	•	In the MongoDB Atlas application, go to the Single Sign-On section and select SAML.
	•	Configure the SAML settings:
	•	Identifier (Entity ID): https://cloud.mongodb.com
	•	Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL): https://cloud.mongodb.com/user_account/<Your_Org_ID>/sso/post
	•	Replace <Your_Org_ID> with your MongoDB Atlas organization ID. You can find this in the Atlas UI under Organization Settings.
	•	Download the Federation Metadata XML from Microsoft Entra. This will be used in MongoDB Atlas.
	4.	Map SAML Attributes:
Add the following claim mappings under Attributes & Claims:
	•	Name ID: user.mail (or use user.principalname if email is not configured).
	•	FirstName: user.givenname
	•	LastName: user.surname

Step 2: Configure MongoDB Atlas for SAML SSO
	1.	Log in to MongoDB Atlas:
Go to the MongoDB Atlas platform and log in with an admin account.
	2.	Enable SAML Authentication:
	•	Go to Organization Settings > SSO Settings.
	•	Enable SAML Authentication.
	3.	Upload Metadata from Microsoft Entra:
	•	Upload the Federation Metadata XML file you downloaded from Microsoft Entra.
	4.	Verify SAML Configuration:
	•	MongoDB Atlas will generate a unique SAML Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL and Entity ID.
	•	Ensure these match the configuration in Microsoft Entra.
	5.	Test SSO:
	•	Add a test user in Microsoft Entra and assign them to the MongoDB Atlas application.
	•	Log in to MongoDB Atlas with the Log in with SSO option using that user’s email.

Step 3: Configure Role Mapping
	1.	Create Custom Roles in MongoDB Atlas:
	•	In MongoDB Atlas, go to Organization Settings > SSO Settings > Role Mappings.
	•	Add role mappings to assign MongoDB roles (e.g., Organization Owner, Project Data Access Admin, etc.) based on SAML group attributes.
	2.	Configure Group Claims in Microsoft Entra:
	•	In the MongoDB Atlas Application in Microsoft Entra, configure Group Claims:
	•	Include groups assigned to the application.
	•	Use the group’s Object ID or Group Name as the claim value.
	3.	Map Groups to MongoDB Roles:
	•	In MongoDB Atlas, add the exact SAML group values (from Microsoft Entra) to the Role Mapping section.
	•	Assign appropriate roles to each group.

Step 4: Test the Setup
	1.	Add test users to the respective groups in Microsoft Entra.
	2.	Ensure users can log in to MongoDB Atlas with their assigned SSO credentials.
	3.	Verify role-based access works as expected (e.g., project-level or organization-level permissions).

Notes:
	•	Ensure clocks are synchronized between Microsoft Entra and MongoDB Atlas to avoid SAML assertion errors.
	•	If using custom claims, ensure they align with MongoDB Atlas requirements.
	•	For troubleshooting, enable SAML debugging in MongoDB Atlas under SSO Settings.
