To resolve MongoDB service blockage by SELinux on RHEL 8 using Ansible, you can create a playbook with roles to manage SELinux policies and MongoDB configurations. Below is a simplified example of Ansible tasks to address this issue:

1. Create an Ansible playbook (e.g., `mongodb_selinux.yml`) to orchestrate the tasks.

```yaml
---
- name: MongoDB SELinux Configuration
  hosts: mongodb_server
  become: yes

  roles:
    - selinux_configuration
    - mongodb_configuration

  tasks:
    - name: Restart MongoDB service
      service:
        name: mongod
        state: restarted
      tags: mongodb_service
```

2. Create an Ansible role for SELinux configuration (e.g., `selinux_configuration/tasks/main.yml`).

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure SELinux is in permissive mode (temporary)
  selinux:
    policy: targeted
    state: permissive
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: Allow MongoDB to bind to network ports
  selinux_permissive:
    seuser: system_u
    serole: object_r
    setype: mongod_port_t
    selevel: s0
    allow: 1
  tags: mongodb_selinux

- name: Allow MongoDB to read/write data
  selinux_permissive:
    seuser: system_u
    serole: object_r
    setype: mongod_db_t
    selevel: s0
    allow: 1
  tags: mongodb_selinux

# Add other MongoDB-specific SELinux configurations if needed

- name: Ensure SELinux is enforcing again (optional)
  selinux:
    policy: targeted
    state: enforcing
  ignore_errors: yes
```

3. Create an Ansible role for MongoDB configuration (e.g., `mongodb_configuration/tasks/main.yml`).

```yaml
---
- name: Install MongoDB packages (adjust package names as needed)
  package:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  with_items:
    - mongodb-org-server
    - mongodb-org-shell
  tags: mongodb_install

- name: Start and enable MongoDB service
  service:
    name: mongod
    state: started
    enabled: yes
  tags: mongodb_service
```

In this setup:

- We have two roles: `selinux_configuration` for SELinux configuration and `mongodb_configuration` for MongoDB installation and service management.
- The SELinux role sets SELinux to permissive mode, allows MongoDB to bind to network ports, and read/write data by adding permissive rules. You can add more SELinux configurations as needed.
- The MongoDB role installs MongoDB packages and starts the MongoDB service.

To execute this playbook on your RHEL 8 server, you need to have Ansible installed, create an inventory file with your server's information, and run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini mongodb_selinux.yml
```

Make sure to customize the playbook and roles based on your specific MongoDB setup and SELinux requirements.
