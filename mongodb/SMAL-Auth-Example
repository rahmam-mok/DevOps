Configuring SAML authentication with Azure AD for MongoDB Atlas involves integrating Azure as your identity provider (IdP) and MongoDB Atlas as the service provider (SP). Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Configure Azure AD

	1.	Sign in to Azure AD:
	•	Go to the Azure Portal.
	•	Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications > New Application.
	2.	Create a New Application:
	•	Click Create your own application.
	•	Name the application (e.g., “MongoDB Atlas SSO”).
	•	Choose Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery and create.
	3.	Set Up SAML Configuration:
	•	Under Manage, select Single sign-on.
	•	Choose SAML as the SSO method.
	4.	Edit Basic SAML Configuration:
	•	Set the following fields:
	•	Identifier (Entity ID): Use the Atlas-provided Entity ID (e.g., https://cloud.mongodb.com).
	•	Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL): Use the ACS URL provided by Atlas (e.g., https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/sso/).
	•	Sign-On URL (optional): Leave blank unless Atlas specifies.
	5.	Download Federation Metadata:
	•	Download the Federation Metadata XML file for later use in MongoDB Atlas.

Step 2: Configure MongoDB Atlas

	1.	Log in to MongoDB Atlas:
	•	Go to MongoDB Atlas.
	•	Navigate to Organization Settings > Authentication.
	2.	Enable SAML:
	•	Enable SAML Authentication.
	•	Upload the Federation Metadata XML file downloaded from Azure AD.
	•	Save the settings.
	3.	Set Organization Entity ID:
	•	Use the same Entity ID configured in Azure AD.
	4.	Test Connection:
	•	Click Test to ensure the SAML integration is successful.

Step 3: Map Roles and Attributes

	1.	In MongoDB Atlas:
	•	Go to Access Management > SAML Roles Mapping.
	•	Map Azure AD groups to Atlas roles (e.g., Organization Owner, Project Admin).
	2.	In Azure AD:
	•	Assign users or groups to the MongoDB Atlas application under Users and Groups.
	•	Ensure the SAML attributes (e.g., Group, Role) are passed correctly to Atlas.

Step 4: Test SSO

	1.	Test Login:
	•	Log in to MongoDB Atlas via the SSO URL (e.g., https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/sso/).
	•	Use an Azure AD account assigned to the Atlas application.
	2.	Verify Role Assignment:
	•	Check that the logged-in user has the correct role and access level based on the role mappings.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting

	•	Assertion Errors: Ensure the Identifier and Reply URL in Azure match the values in Atlas.
	•	Role Mapping Issues: Verify that group names in Azure match the role mappings in Atlas exactly.
	•	Time Skew: Check that both systems have synchronized time settings to avoid SAML assertion expiration errors.
