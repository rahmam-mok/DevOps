Creating an Ansible playbook to install MongoDB Enterprise 4.4, configure a custom `mongod.conf` file, create a MongoDB user, and enable it as a service on RHEL 8.8 with SELinux enabled involves multiple tasks. Below is a high-level Ansible playbook to achieve this. Please customize it to suit your specific environment and requirements:

```yaml
---
- name: MongoDB Installation and Configuration
  hosts: your_target_servers
  become: yes
  vars:
    mongodb_version: 4.4
    mongodb_user: your_mongodb_user
    mongodb_password: your_mongodb_password
    custom_port: your_custom_port
    custom_log_directory: /path/to/your/custom/log/directory
    custom_data_directory: /path/to/your/custom/data/directory

  tasks:
    - name: Download MongoDB Enterprise 4.4 repository file
      get_url:
        url: https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/redhat/8Server/mongodb-enterprise/{{ mongodb_version }}/x86_64/RPMS/mongodb-enterprise.repo
        dest: /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-enterprise.repo

    - name: Install MongoDB Enterprise
      yum:
        name: mongodb-enterprise
        state: present

    - name: Create custom MongoDB data directory
      file:
        path: "{{ custom_data_directory }}"
        state: directory
        owner: mongod
        group: mongod
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Create custom MongoDB log directory
      file:
        path: "{{ custom_log_directory }}"
        state: directory
        owner: mongod
        group: mongod
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Copy custom mongod.conf file
      copy:
        src: files/mongod.conf  # Create a custom mongod.conf file on your Ansible control machine and specify its path here
        dest: /etc/mongod.conf
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Set SELinux boolean for MongoDB
      selinux:
        boolean: mongod_connect_any
        state: yes

    - name: Start MongoDB service
      service:
        name: mongod
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Create MongoDB user
      mongodb_user:
        login_user: admin
        login_password: admin_password  # Change to your admin user and password
        database: admin
        name: "{{ mongodb_user }}"
        password: "{{ mongodb_password }}"
        roles: readWriteAnyDatabase
```

This playbook does the following:

1. Downloads the MongoDB Enterprise repository file.
2. Installs MongoDB Enterprise.
3. Creates custom data and log directories as defined.
4. Copies a custom `mongod.conf` file to `/etc/mongod.conf`.
5. Sets the necessary SELinux boolean for MongoDB.
6. Starts the MongoDB service.
7. Creates a MongoDB user.

Make sure to replace `your_target_servers`, `your_mongodb_user`, `your_mongodb_password`, `your_custom_port`, `your_custom_log_directory`, and `your_custom_data_directory` with your specific values. Also, create the custom `mongod.conf` file on your Ansible control machine and specify its path in the playbook. Additionally, adjust the MongoDB admin user and password used in the playbook to your environment.




The `mongod_connect_any` SELinux boolean is used to control whether the MongoDB server process (`mongod`) is allowed to make network connections to any remote MongoDB instances, regardless of the source port or IP address. 

When SELinux is enforcing, it imposes additional security policies on top of the standard Linux discretionary access control (DAC). These policies can restrict network connections, file access, and other system-level interactions to enhance system security.

In the context of MongoDB, setting `mongod_connect_any` to `on` (or `yes` as in the Ansible playbook example) allows the `mongod` process to connect to other MongoDB instances without being restricted by SELinux policies. This can be useful in scenarios where you have a distributed MongoDB setup or when `mongod` instances need to communicate with each other over the network.

However, enabling this SELinux boolean should be done with caution, as it loosens a security restriction. You should only enable it if you have a specific need for `mongod` to connect to other MongoDB instances across the network, and you have other security measures in place to protect your MongoDB deployment.

Always consider the security implications when modifying SELinux policies and consult with your organization's security policies and guidelines before making such changes.


Remember to customize and secure your MongoDB installation further based on your organization's security requirements.
