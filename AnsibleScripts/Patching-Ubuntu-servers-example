Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that automates patching Ubuntu servers without updating Java or JDK, checks if a reboot is required, reboots the servers if necessary, and verifies that the servers have been successfully rebooted:

```yaml
---
- name: Patch and reboot Ubuntu servers
  hosts: ubuntu_servers
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Exclude Java and JDK packages
      apt:
        name: "*"
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes
        only_upgrade: yes
        allow_unauthenticated: yes
        force_apt_get: yes
        dpkg_options: "force-confdef,force-confold"
        upgrade_dist: full-upgrade
        autoremove: yes
        install_recommends: no
        hold_pkgs: "java,jdk"
      register: apt_result

    - name: Check if reboot is required
      shell: needs-restarting -r
      register: reboot_check
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

    - name: Reboot servers
      reboot:
      when: reboot_check.stdout != "0"

    - name: Verify servers have been rebooted
      wait_for_connection:
        connect_timeout: 60
        sleep: 10
        delay: 10
        timeout: 300
      register: reboot_verify

    - name: Print reboot status
      debug:
        msg: "Servers have been rebooted."
      when: reboot_verify is succeeded
```

In this example, make sure to replace `ubuntu_servers` with the appropriate group of servers in your Ansible inventory file. The playbook uses the `apt` module to update and upgrade packages, excluding the `java` and `jdk` packages using the `hold_pkgs` parameter.

Please note that the `needs-restarting` command is used to check if a reboot is required, and it might not be available by default on Ubuntu. You may need to install the `yum-utils` package or a similar alternative that provides the `needs-restarting` functionality.

As always, remember to test the playbook in a non-production environment before applying it to production servers.
