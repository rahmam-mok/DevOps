To log in to an AWS Windows Server instance and install the Raising Server, you can use the following Ansible playbook as a starting point:

```yaml
---
- name: Login to AWS Windows Server and install Raising Server
 hosts: windows_server
 gather_facts: false
 become: true
 vars:
   aws_access_key: "your_aws_access_key"
   aws_secret_key: "your_aws_secret_key"
   ec2_region: "your_ec2_region"
   instance_id: "your_instance_id"
   raising_server_installer_url: "https://path/to/raising_server_installer.exe"

 tasks:
   - name: Install AWS CLI
     win_chocolatey:
       name: awscli
       state: present

   - name: Configure AWS credentials
     win_command: aws configure set aws_access_key_id {{ aws_access_key }} && aws configure set aws_secret_access_key {{ aws_secret_key }} && aws configure set default.region {{ ec2_region }}

   - name: Download Raising Server installer
     win_get_url:
       url: "{{ raising_server_installer_url }}"
       dest: "C:\\Temp\\raising_server_installer.exe"

   - name: Install Raising Server
     win_command: C:\\Temp\\raising_server_installer.exe /quiet

   - name: Restart Raising Server service
     win_service:
       name: RaisingServer
       state: restarted
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with the actual values:

- `"your_aws_access_key"` and `"your_aws_secret_key"` with your AWS access key and secret key.
- `"your_ec2_region"` with the region where your Windows Server instance is located (e.g., "us-east-1").
- `"your_instance_id"` with the ID of your Windows Server instance.
- `"https://path/to/raising_server_installer.exe"` with the URL to the Raising Server installer executable.

This playbook assumes that you have already configured the necessary AWS CLI credentials on your Ansible control machine.

Remember to adjust this playbook according to your specific requirements, such as modifying the paths, filenames, and installer options, and test it thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment.
