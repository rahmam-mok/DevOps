# #Make sure to have the following directory structure for templates:

# ```
# .
# ├── playbook.yml
# └── templates
#    ├── inputs.conf.j2
#    └── outputs.conf.j2
# ```

# The `inputs.conf.j2` and `outputs.conf.j2` files inside the `templates` directory should contain the configuration settings for your Splunk Universal Forwarder. You can customize these files according to your needs.

# Remember to adjust this playbook and the template files according to your specific requirements and test it thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment.
