here's a basic example of an Ansible playbook that could be used to install resin servers on a Windows Server machine. Please note that the exact steps might vary depending on the version of Resin and Windows Server you're working with. You might need to adjust this playbook accordingly.

---
- name: Install Resin Servers on Windows
  hosts: windows_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Resin Installer
      win_copy:
        src: /path/to/resin/installer.exe
        dest: C:\temp\resin_installer.exe

    - name: Run Resin Installer
      win_shell: |
        Start-Process -FilePath "C:\temp\resin_installer.exe" -ArgumentList "/silent"
      register: install_result
      until: install_result.rc == 0
      retries: 3
      delay: 5

    - name: Check Installation Status
      win_stat:
        path: C:\Program Files\Resin
      register: resin_folder

    - name: Ensure Resin is Installed
      fail:
        msg: "Resin installation failed."
      when: resin_folder.exists == False


Remember to replace `/path/to/resin/installer.exe` with the actual path to the Resin installer executable on your system. Also, replace `windows_servers` with the group or hostname of your Windows Server target.

Keep in mind that this example is a simplified playbook and doesn't handle all potential edge cases. You might need to adjust it based on your specific environment and requirements. Also, ensure that you have proper permissions and network connectivity to execute Ansible tasks on the Windows Server machines.
