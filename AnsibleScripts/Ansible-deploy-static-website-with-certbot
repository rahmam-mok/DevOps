To deploy a single HTML page on an Apache server running on Red Hat 8 and install an SSL certificate to allow the website to be accessible only via HTTPS using Ansible, you can create an Ansible playbook that performs these tasks. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Ansible:**
   Ensure that Ansible is installed on your local machine.

2. **Create an Ansible Playbook:**
   Create a playbook, e.g., `deploy_website.yml`, and define the tasks within it.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy HTML page and enable HTTPS
  hosts: your_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      dnf:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Apache
      systemd:
        name: httpd
        enabled: yes
        state: started

    - name: Copy HTML page to Apache Document Root
      copy:
        src: path_to_your_index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: Install Certbot and Apache plugin
      dnf:
        name: certbot python3-certbot-apache
        state: present

    - name: Obtain SSL certificate
      command: certbot --apache -d your_domain.com --non-interactive --agree-tos --email your_email@example.com
      args:
        creates: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain.com/fullchain.pem

    - name: Configure HTTPS-only access
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
        line: "Redirect permanent / https://your_domain.com/"
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      systemd:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

In this playbook:
- Replace `your_server` with the hostname or IP address of your Red Hat 8 server.
- Replace `path_to_your_index.html` with the actual path to your HTML page.
- Replace `your_domain.com` with your website's domain name.
- Replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address.

3. **Run the Ansible Playbook:**
   Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook deploy_website.yml
```

This playbook will deploy your HTML page, install an SSL certificate, and configure Apache to enforce HTTPS-only access. Make sure your server is reachable from your Ansible control machine, and that SSH keys are set up for authentication.

After running the playbook successfully, your website will be accessible only via HTTPS, and your HTML page will be served securely by Apache on Red Hat 8.
