Here's an example of an Ansible playbook that automates patching Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 servers, checks if a reboot is required, reboots the servers if necessary, and verifies that the servers have been successfully rebooted:
---
- name: Patch and reboot RHEL 8 servers
  hosts: rhel_servers
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Patch servers
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
      register: yum_result

    - name: Check if reboot is required
      shell: needs-restarting -r
      register: reboot_check
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

    - name: Reboot servers
      reboot:
      when: reboot_check.stdout != "0"

    - name: Verify servers have been rebooted
      wait_for_connection:
        connect_timeout: 60
        sleep: 10
        delay: 10
        timeout: 300
      register: reboot_verify

    - name: Print reboot status
      debug:
        msg: "Servers have been rebooted."
      when: reboot_verify is succeeded
```

In this example, make sure to replace `rhel_servers` with the appropriate group of servers in your Ansible inventory file. You can run this playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command.

Please note that this playbook assumes the `needs-restarting` command is available on your servers to check if a reboot is required. Additionally, it's always recommended to test scripts and playbooks in a non-production environment before applying them to production servers.
