To install the Nagios LDAP module and configure LDAP or Active Directory authentication, you'll need to perform two main tasks: 

1. Install the LDAP module for Nagios.
2. Configure Nagios to use LDAP or Active Directory for authentication.

Here's an Ansible playbook that accomplishes these tasks:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Nagios LDAP Module and Configure LDAP/AD Authentication
  hosts: your_nagios_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install required LDAP development packages
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - openldap-devel
        - php-ldap
        - nagios-plugins-ldap  # This is an example; adjust the package name as needed for your distribution.

    - name: Enable LDAP module in Nagios configuration
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg  # Modify the path if your configuration file is located elsewhere.
        regexp: "^broker_module="
        line: "broker_module=/usr/lib/nagios/brokers/ldap.so"
        state: present

    - name: Configure LDAP/AD Authentication
      template:
        src: ldap_auth.cfg.j2
        dest: /etc/nagios/ldap_auth.cfg
      notify:
        - Restart Nagios

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nagios
      service:
        name: nagios
        state: restarted
```

In this playbook:

1. The first task installs the required LDAP development packages and the `php-ldap` package, which provides LDAP support for PHP used by Nagios.

2. The second task enables the LDAP module by adding the necessary line to the Nagios configuration file. Be sure to adjust the `path` to your actual Nagios configuration file path.

3. The third task configures LDAP/AD authentication by creating an LDAP configuration file named `ldap_auth.cfg`. Here's an example `ldap_auth.cfg.j2` template:

```ini
define command {
    command_name    check_ldap
    command_line    $USER1$/check_ldap -H ldap://your_ldap_server -b "cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -P "your_ldap_password" -3 $ARG1$
}
```

Modify the LDAP server URL, base DN, bind DN, and password to match your LDAP or Active Directory configuration.

4. After enabling the LDAP module and configuring LDAP/AD authentication, the playbook notifies the "Restart Nagios" handler to restart the Nagios service to apply the changes.

Run the Ansible playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_nagios_ldap.yml
```

This playbook installs the LDAP module for Nagios and configures it to use LDAP/AD for user authentication. Customize it further to suit your specific distribution and environment if needed.
