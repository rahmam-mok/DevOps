 Here's an example of an Ansible script that downloads a zip file from Nexus, waits for the download to complete, and then unzips the folder:

```yaml
- name: Download and unzip file from Nexus
  hosts: your_host
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    nexus_url: "http://your_nexus_server/repository/your_repository/your_file.zip"
    download_path: "/path/to/download/location"
    unzip_path: "/path/to/unzip/location"

  tasks:
    - name: Create download directory
      file:
        path: "{{ download_path }}"
        state: directory

    - name: Download the zip file
      get_url:
        url: "{{ nexus_url }}"
        dest: "{{ download_path }}/your_file.zip"

    - name: Wait for the download to complete
      wait_for:
        path: "{{ download_path }}/your_file.zip"
        state: present

    - name: Create unzip directory
      file:
        path: "{{ unzip_path }}"
        state: directory

    - name: Unzip the file
      command: unzip "{{ download_path }}/your_file.zip" -d "{{ unzip_path }}"
```

Make sure to replace `your_host`, `your_nexus_server`, `your_repository`, `your_file.zip`, `download_path`, and `unzip_path` with your specific values. Also, ensure that the target machine has the `unzip` command installed.

This script creates a directory for the download, downloads the zip file from Nexus, waits for the file to be fully downloaded, creates a directory for the unzip process, and finally unzips the file into the specified location.

Remember to adjust the playbook according to your specific requirements, such as handling authentication if required.
