 here's an example Ansible playbook to install Apache Tomcat on a Windows Server 2022 machine using Ansible:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache Tomcat on Windows
  hosts: windows_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Download Tomcat Installer
      win_get_url:
        url: "https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.54/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.54-windows-x64.zip"
        dest: "C:\\temp\\tomcat.zip"

    - name: Unzip Tomcat Archive
      win_unzip:
        src: "C:\\temp\\tomcat.zip"
        dest: "C:\\Tomcat"
        creates_path: yes

    - name: Set Tomcat Environment Variables
      win_environment:
        name: CATALINA_HOME
        value: "C:\\Tomcat\\apache-tomcat-9.0.54"
        state: present

    - name: Add Tomcat Bin Directory to PATH
      win_environment:
        name: PATH
        value: "{{ ansible_env.PATH }};C:\\Tomcat\\apache-tomcat-9.0.54\\bin"
        state: present
        notify: Update Environment

    - name: Start Tomcat Service
      win_command: "C:\\Tomcat\\apache-tomcat-9.0.54\\bin\\startup.bat"
```

Make sure to replace `windows_servers` with the appropriate host or group name in your Ansible inventory. Also, modify the Tomcat version and URLs in the `win_get_url` task to match your requirements.

The above playbook downloads the Tomcat zip archive, extracts it to `C:\Tomcat`, sets the necessary environment variables (`CATALINA_HOME` and `PATH`), and then starts the Tomcat service using `startup.bat`.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified playbook and may need adjustments based on your environment and requirements. Additionally, ensure you have proper permissions to execute Ansible tasks on the Windows Server machine.
