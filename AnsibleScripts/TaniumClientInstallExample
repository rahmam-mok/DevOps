Certainly! Below is an example Ansible playbook for installing and configuring TaniumClient on Red Hat 8:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Configure TaniumClient on Red Hat 8
  hosts: your_target_servers
  become: true  # Run tasks with elevated privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Download TaniumClient installer
      get_url:
        url: "https://path/to/your/TaniumClientInstaller.rpm"
        dest: "/tmp/TaniumClientInstaller.rpm"

    - name: Install TaniumClient
      package:
        name: "/tmp/TaniumClientInstaller.rpm"
        state: present

    - name: Configure TaniumClient
      template:
        src: templates/taniumclient.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/tanium/taniumclient/taniumclient.conf
      notify:
        - Restart TaniumClient

  handlers:
    - name: Restart TaniumClient
      service:
        name: taniumclient
        state: restarted
        enabled: yes
```

Explanation:

1. Download the TaniumClient installer using `get_url`.
2. Install TaniumClient using the `package` module.
3. Configure TaniumClient by using a Jinja2 template (replace `templates/taniumclient.conf.j2` with your actual configuration template).
4. Notify a handler to restart TaniumClient when the configuration changes.

Make sure to replace `"https://path/to/your/TaniumClientInstaller.rpm"` with the actual URL of your TaniumClient installer. Also, update the `hosts` field with the target servers where you want to install TaniumClient.

Save the playbook in a file, for example, `install_configure_tanium.yml`, and execute it with:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_configure_tanium.yml
```

Ensure that you customize the configuration template according to your TaniumClient settings.


The content of your `taniumclient.conf.j2` file will depend on your specific TaniumClient configuration requirements. Below is a generic example to give you an idea. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Tanium configuration parameters:

```ini
[Client]
  Name = {{ tanium_client_name }}
  Server = {{ tanium_server_address }}
  Port = {{ tanium_server_port }}
  ZoneName = {{ tanium_zone_name }}

[OtherSection]
  # Additional TaniumClient configuration parameters can be added here
  # Example:
  # SomeParameter = SomeValue
```

In this example:

- `{{ tanium_client_name }}`: The name you want to assign to the TaniumClient.
- `{{ tanium_server_address }}`: The address of your Tanium server.
- `{{ tanium_server_port }}`: The port on which Tanium server is running.
- `{{ tanium_zone_name }}`: The zone name for Tanium (optional, depends on your Tanium setup).

Add any other configuration parameters you need under the `[Client]` section or other sections as specified by Tanium's documentation.

When using this template in your Ansible playbook, make sure to pass these variables using the `vars` section or define them in your inventory file.

Remember to refer to Tanium's official documentation for specific configuration details based on your deployment.
