 Here's a basic example of an Ansible playbook to uninstall the existing TaniumClient and reinstall it on Red Hat 8:

```yaml
---
- name: Uninstall and Reinstall TaniumClient
  hosts: your_target_server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Stop TaniumClient service
      systemd:
        name: taniumclient
        state: stopped
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Remove TaniumClient directory
      file:
        path: /opt/TaniumClient
        state: absent

    - name: Uninstall TaniumClient
      command: /path/to/uninstall-script.sh
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Create TaniumClient directory
      file:
        path: /opt/TaniumClient
        state: directory

    - name: Copy TaniumClient installation files
      copy:
        src: /path/to/taniumclient-installer.tar.gz
        dest: /opt/TaniumClient/

    - name: Extract TaniumClient installation files
      ansible.builtin.unarchive:
        src: /opt/TaniumClient/taniumclient-installer.tar.gz
        dest: /opt/TaniumClient/

    - name: Run TaniumClient installer
      command: /opt/TaniumClient/install.sh

    - name: Start TaniumClient service
      systemd:
        name: taniumclient
        state: started
```

Make sure to replace "your_target_server" with the actual target server's hostname or IP address. Also, replace "/path/to/uninstall-script.sh" and "/path/to/taniumclient-installer.tar.gz" with the appropriate paths for your TaniumClient uninstall script and installation files.

Remember to adapt this playbook according to your specific TaniumClient setup and requirements.
