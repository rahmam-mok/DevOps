Here's an updated version of the Ansible playbook that automates patching Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 servers without updating Java or JDK, checks if a reboot is required, reboots the servers if necessary, and verifies that the servers have been successfully rebooted:

```yaml
---
- name: Patch and reboot RHEL 8 servers
  hosts: rhel_servers
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Exclude Java and JDK packages
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
        exclude: java,jdk
      register: yum_result

    - name: Check if reboot is required
      shell: needs-restarting -r
      register: reboot_check
      changed_when: false
      failed_when: false

    - name: Reboot servers
      reboot:
      when: reboot_check.stdout != "0"

    - name: Verify servers have been rebooted
      wait_for_connection:
        connect_timeout: 60
        sleep: 10
        delay: 10
        timeout: 300
      register: reboot_verify

    - name: Print reboot status
      debug:
        msg: "Servers have been rebooted."
      when: reboot_verify is succeeded
```

In this updated playbook, the `exclude` parameter is added to the `yum` task, specifying that the `java` and `jdk` packages should be excluded from the update. This ensures that Java and JDK packages are not updated during the patching process.

Again, please make sure to replace `rhel_servers` with the appropriate group of servers in your Ansible inventory file. Remember to test this playbook in a non-production environment before applying it to production servers.
