# Make sure to replace `your_target_host` with the actual hostname or IP address of your target Red Hat 8 server. Adjust the URLs and package names for JBoss EAP accordingly based on your environment.

# Save this playbook in a file (e.g., `install_apps.yml`) and execute it using the `ansible-playbook` command:

# ```bash
# ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini install_apps.yml
# ```

# Remember to adjust the `inventory.ini` file to include the appropriate host or group of hosts you want to target.

# This playbook will install OpenJDK 1.8, Nginx, Apache HTTP Server (httpd), and JBoss EAP on the specified host, and start the Nginx, httpd, and JBoss EAP services.
