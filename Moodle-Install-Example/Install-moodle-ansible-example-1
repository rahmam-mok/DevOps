To install PHP, Moodle, and configure Apache HTTPD for SSL on RHEL 8 using Ansible, you can use the following playbook. Make sure you have Ansible set up and SSH access configured to your RHEL 8 server.

```yaml

      register: download_result

    - name: Extract Moodle

        dest: "/var/www/html/"
      when: download_result.changed

    - name: Set permissions for Moodle
      file:
        path: "/var/www/html/moodle"

    - name: Configure Apache for SSL
      template:
        src: ssl.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

In this playbook:

1. Replace `your_target_server` with the IP address or hostname of your RHEL 8 server.
2. Set the appropriate MySQL/MariaDB password in the `password` field.
3. This playbook also configures SSL for Apache HTTPD. You'll need to create an SSL certificate file (`ssl.conf.j2`) and place it in the same directory as your playbook. Make sure to adjust the SSL configuration file to suit your specific needs.

Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `install_moodle_ssl.yml`) and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command on your Ansible control machine.
