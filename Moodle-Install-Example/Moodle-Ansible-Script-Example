To install Moodle on Red Hat 8.8 using Ansible, you'll need to create an Ansible playbook. Below is a sample playbook that you can use as a starting point:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Moodle on Red Hat 8.8
  hosts: your_server
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update package cache
      dnf:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install required packages
      dnf:
        name:
          - httpd
          - mariadb-server
          - php
          - php-mysqlnd
          - php-xml
          - php-json
          - php-zip
          - php-gd
          - php-intl
          - php-opcache
          - php-mbstring
          - php-curl
          - php-ldap
          - php-xmlrpc
          - php-soap
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Apache
      systemd:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Start and enable MariaDB
      systemd:
        name: mariadb
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Secure MariaDB installation
      mysql_user:
        name: root
        host: localhost
        password: your_root_password_here
        login_user: root
        login_password: ''
        priv: '*.*:ALL,GRANT'
        state: present
      register: mysql_secure_result
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Create Moodle database
      mysql_db:
        name: moodle
        collation: utf8mb4_general_ci
        state: present
        login_user: root
        login_password: your_root_password_here

    - name: Download Moodle
      get_url:
        url: "https://download.moodle.org/download.php/latest/stable??version=28&format=tar.gz"
        dest: /tmp/moodle.tar.gz

    - name: Extract Moodle
      unarchive:
        src: /tmp/moodle.tar.gz
        dest: /var/www/html/
        remote_src: yes
        creates: /var/www/html/moodle

    - name: Set Moodle directory permissions
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/moodle
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        state: directory
        recurse: yes

    - name: Set Moodle data directory permissions
      file:
        path: /var/moodledata
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        state: directory

    - name: Configure Moodle virtual host
      template:
        src: moodle.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/moodle.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      systemd:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

Before running this playbook, make sure you have Ansible installed on your system. Also, replace `your_server` with the target server's IP or hostname, and replace `your_root_password_here` with the actual root password for the MariaDB server.

In the playbook, we are updating the package cache, installing required packages (Apache, MariaDB, and PHP with necessary extensions), securing MariaDB, creating the Moodle database, downloading Moodle, and configuring Apache to serve Moodle. Additionally, we are setting appropriate permissions for the Moodle directory and data directory.

To use this playbook, save it in a file, for example, `install_moodle.yml`. Then, execute the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_moodle.yml
```

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the playbook based on your specific environment and requirements. You can also create a `moodle.conf.j2` template file for Apache virtual host configuration if needed.
