#Ansible playbook scripts to custom install production ready Moodle on RedHat 

Create a playbook file (e.g., install_moodle.yml) with the following content:


---
- name: Install Moodle on RHEL
  hosts: your_host_name
  become: yes

  vars:
    moodle_version: "3.11"  # Set the desired Moodle version
    php_version: "7.4"  # Set the desired PHP version

  tasks:
    - name: Install EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    - name: Install Apache web server
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable Apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Install PHP and required PHP extensions
      yum:
        name:
          - php
          - php-mysqlnd
          - php-xml
          - php-intl
          - php-zip
          - php-gd
          - php-opcache
          - php-ldap
        state: present

    - name: Install MariaDB server
      yum:
        name: mariadb-server
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable MariaDB service
      service:
        name: mariadb
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Secure MariaDB installation
      shell: mysql_secure_installation
      args:
        creates: /root/.mysql_secure_installation_completed

    - name: Clone Moodle repository
      git:
        repo: "https://github.com/moodle/moodle.git"
        dest: "/var/www/html/moodle"
        version: "{{ moodle_version }}"
        depth: 1

    - name: Set ownership and permissions for Moodle directory
      file:
        path: "/var/www/html/moodle"
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        mode: "0755"
        recurse: yes

    - name: Configure Moodle virtual host
      template:
        src: "moodle.conf.j2"
        dest: "/etc/httpd/conf.d/moodle.conf"

    - name: Restart Apache service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted




Create a Jinja2 template file named moodle.conf.j2 with the following content:


<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/moodle

    <Directory /var/www/html/moodle>
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/moodle_error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/moodle_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>



Replace your_host_name with the target host or group of hosts where you want to install Moodle.
Set the desired version for Moodle by updating the moodle_version variable.
Set the desired version for PHP by updating the php_version variable.
Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command:


ansible-playbook install_moodle.yml


This playbook installs the necessary dependencies, including Apache web server, PHP, and MariaDB. It then clones the Moodle repository, sets ownership and permissions for the Moodle directory, configures the Apache virtual host, and restarts the Apache service.

Please note that this playbook assumes you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed on your system to run Moodle. Make sure to adjust any
