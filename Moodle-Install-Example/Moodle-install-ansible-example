 Below is a simple Ansible playbook that you can use to install PHP, Moodle, and other dependencies on a RHEL 8 system. This playbook assumes you have already set up Ansible on your control machine and configured SSH access to the target RHEL 8 server.

```yaml
---
- name: Install Moodle and PHP on RHEL 8
  hosts: your_target_server
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update YUM cache
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

    - name: Install EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    - name: Install required packages
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - httpd
        - php
        - php-mysqlnd
        - php-gd
        - php-xml
        - php-intl
        - php-json
        - mariadb-server
        - mariadb
        - mariadb-client
        - unzip
        - wget
        - git

    - name: Start and enable Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Start and enable MariaDB
      service:
        name: mariadb
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Secure MariaDB installation
      command: mysql_secure_installation
      args:
        creates: "/root/.my.cnf"
      when: "'/root/.my.cnf' not in (ansible_facts.home_directory | string)+'/.'+ansible_facts.user_name"

    - name: Create Moodle database and user
      mysql_db:
        name: moodle
        state: present
      become_user: root

    - name: Create Moodle database user
      mysql_user:
        name: moodleuser
        password: your_password_here
        priv: "moodle.*:ALL"
        host: localhost
        state: present
      become_user: root

    - name: Download Moodle
      get_url:
        url: "https://download.moodle.org/download.php/stable310/moodle-latest-310.tgz"
        dest: "/tmp/moodle-latest.tgz"
      register: download_result

    - name: Extract Moodle
      unarchive:
        src: "/tmp/moodle-latest.tgz"
        dest: "/var/www/html/"
      when: download_result.changed

    - name: Set permissions for Moodle
      file:
        path: "/var/www/html/moodle"
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        recurse: yes
      become_user: root

    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted

    - name: Open HTTP port in firewall
      firewalld:
        service: http
        state: enabled
        permanent: yes
      become_user: root
```

Make sure to replace `your_target_server` with the IP address or hostname of your RHEL 8 server, and set the appropriate MySQL/MariaDB password in the `password` field. You may also need to adjust the Moodle download URL to the desired version.

Save this playbook to a file, such as `install_moodle.yml`, and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command on your Ansible control machine.
