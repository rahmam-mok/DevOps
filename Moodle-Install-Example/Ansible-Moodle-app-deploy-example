To install PHP, deploy the Moodle app with an AWS RDS MySQL database, and configure Apache HTTPD for SSL with a certificate for a web application on RHEL 8 using Ansible, you'll need a more comprehensive playbook. This playbook will also require additional configuration files for the Moodle app and SSL certificate. Here's a high-level playbook structure:

```yaml
---
- name: Install PHP, Deploy Moodle, and Configure HTTPD for SSL on RHEL 8
  hosts: your_target_server
  become: yes
  vars:
    db_host: your_rds_endpoint
    db_user: your_db_user
    db_password: your_db_password
    moodle_url: https://your-moodle-url.com
    ssl_cert_path: /path/to/ssl/certificate.crt
    ssl_key_path: /path/to/ssl/privatekey.key
  tasks:
    - name: Update YUM cache
      yum:
        name: '*'
        state: latest

    - name: Install EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: epel-release
        state: present

    # Install other dependencies like httpd, PHP, unzip, etc.

    # Configure and secure MariaDB/RDS connection
    - name: Secure MariaDB connection
      template:
        src: my.cnf.j2
        dest: /etc/my.cnf
      notify:
        - Restart MariaDB

    - name: Create Moodle database and user
      mysql_db:
        name: moodle
        state: present
      become_user: root

    - name: Create Moodle database user
      mysql_user:
        name: moodleuser
        password: "{{ db_password }}"
        priv: "moodle.*:ALL"
        host: "{{ db_host }}"
        state: present
      become_user: root

    - name: Download and deploy Moodle
      get_url:
        url: "https://download.moodle.org/download.php/stable310/moodle-latest-310.tgz"
        dest: "/tmp/moodle-latest.tgz"
      register: download_result

    - name: Extract Moodle
      unarchive:
        src: "/tmp/moodle-latest.tgz"
        dest: "/var/www/html/"
      when: download_result.changed

    - name: Set permissions for Moodle
      file:
        path: "/var/www/html/moodle"
        owner: apache
        group: apache
        recurse: yes
      become_user: root

    # Install and configure mod_ssl for HTTPS
    - name: Install mod_ssl
      yum:
        name: mod_ssl
        state: present

    - name: Copy SSL certificate and private key
      copy:
        src: "{{ ssl_cert_path }}"
        dest: /etc/pki/tls/certs/your_cert.crt
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

    - name: Copy SSL key
      copy:
        src: "{{ ssl_key_path }}"
        dest: /etc/pki/tls/private/your_private_key.key
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

    - name: Configure Apache for SSL
      template:
        src: ssl.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
      notify:
        - Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart MariaDB
      service:
        name: mariadb
        state: restarted

    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

In this playbook:

- Replace `your_target_server` with the IP address or hostname of your RHEL 8 server.
- Set the variables like `db_host`, `db_user`, `db_password`, `moodle_url`, `ssl_cert_path`, and `ssl_key_path` to your specific values.
- You'll need to create custom configuration files (e.g., `my.cnf.j2`, `ssl.conf.j2`) for MariaDB/RDS and SSL certificate settings, respectively, and place them in the same directory as your playbook.

Make sure to replace the download URL for Moodle with the desired version, and customize any other settings to match your specific requirements. Save this playbook to a file (e.g., `install_moodle_ssl.yml`) and run it using the `ansible-playbook` command on your Ansible control machine.




The `ssl.conf.j2` file is a Jinja2 template that you can use to configure Apache HTTPD for SSL (HTTPS). Below is an example `ssl.conf.j2` file with some basic SSL settings. You may need to customize it further based on your specific SSL certificate and server configuration:

```apache
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@your-domain.com
        ServerName your-moodle-url.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/moodle

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/your_cert.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/your_private_key.key

        # Optional: SSLCertificateChainFile for intermediate certificates

        <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
            SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        </FilesMatch>

        <Directory /var/www/html/moodle>
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>

        ErrorLog logs/ssl_error_log
        TransferLog logs/ssl_access_log
        LogLevel warn

        # Additional SSL configurations can go here
    </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

In this template:

- Replace `ServerAdmin`, `ServerName`, and `DocumentRoot` with your server's details and Moodle directory path.
- Set the `SSLCertificateFile` and `SSLCertificateKeyFile` to the paths of your SSL certificate and private key files, respectively.
- You may need to add an `SSLCertificateChainFile` directive if you have intermediate certificates.
- Customize the `<Directory>` section to match your Moodle application's configuration if necessary.
- You can also add additional SSL configurations based on your requirements.

Remember to place this `ssl.conf.j2` file in the same directory as your Ansible playbook, and the playbook will use this template to configure SSL for Apache HTTPD when you run it.
