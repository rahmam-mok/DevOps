To configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder to forward JBoss log located at `/opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log` to a Splunk server, follow these steps:

1. **Install Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
   - Ensure you have the Splunk Universal Forwarder installed on the machine where JBoss is running. Download and install it if you haven't already.

2. **Configure Inputs**:
   - Open the Splunk Universal Forwarder's configuration file for inputs, typically located at `/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
   ```

3. **Add an Input Configuration**:
   - Add a stanza for monitoring the JBoss log file. Here's an example input configuration for `/opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log`:

   ```plaintext
   [monitor:///opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log]
   disabled = false
   index = jboss_logs
   sourcetype = jboss_server
   ```

   - In this configuration:
     - `[monitor:///opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log]` tells the Universal Forwarder to monitor the specified log file.
     - `disabled = false` enables the input.
     - `index` and `sourcetype` are used to specify the index and sourcetype in Splunk. You can customize these values to match your environment.

4. **Save and Exit**:
   - Save the `inputs.conf` file and exit the text editor.

5. **Restart Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
   - Restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder to apply the new configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
   ```

6. **Verify**:
   - Verify that the Universal Forwarder is correctly monitoring and forwarding the JBoss log file by checking the Splunk server for the indexed data.

7. **Splunk Configuration**:
   - On the Splunk server, you can configure indexes, sourcetypes, and any custom settings for the forwarded JBoss logs. Make sure to set up appropriate source types and index settings for the data.

8. **Search and Visualize**:
   - After configuring Splunk, you can use Splunk's search and visualization capabilities to analyze the JBoss log data.

Please ensure that the file paths and configurations are adjusted according to your specific JBoss and Splunk setups. You might need to make adjustments based on your organization's naming conventions and log file locations.
