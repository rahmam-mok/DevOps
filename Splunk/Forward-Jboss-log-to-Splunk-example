To configure a Splunk Universal Forwarder to forward JBoss log files located at `/opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log` to a Splunk server, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
   If you haven't already, download and install Splunk Universal Forwarder on the machine where the JBoss logs are located. You can download it from the official Splunk website.

2. **Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
   Open the configuration file for Splunk Universal Forwarder, which is typically located at `/opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf`. You can use your preferred text editor to edit this file.

3. **Add a Monitor Input**:
   In the `inputs.conf` file, add a stanza to specify which log file to monitor. For your case, you want to monitor the JBoss log file. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```plaintext
   [monitor:///opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log]
   disabled = false
   index = <your_index_name>
   sourcetype = <your_sourcetype>
   ```

   - `/opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log`: This is the path to your JBoss log file.
   - `<your_index_name>`: Replace this with the name of the index where you want to store this data in Splunk.
   - `<your_sourcetype>`: Replace this with the desired sourcetype for your JBoss logs.

4. **Save and Close the Configuration File**.

5. **Restart Splunk Universal Forwarder**:
   After saving the configuration, restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder to apply the changes. You can do this using the following command:

   ```bash
   /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
   ```

6. **Configure Splunk Server**:
   On your Splunk server, make sure it is properly configured to receive data from the Universal Forwarder. This typically involves configuring inputs and ensuring the necessary network connectivity is in place. You may need to set up a receiving port and firewall rules if applicable.

7. **Verify Data Forwarding**:
   Check your Splunk server's data inputs to ensure that the logs from the Universal Forwarder are being received and indexed correctly.

That's it! The Splunk Universal Forwarder should now be configured to forward the JBoss logs to your Splunk server. Make sure that the Splunk server is set up to process the incoming data, and you should be able to search and analyze the JBoss log data using Splunk.
