You can use Ansible to automate the configuration of a Splunk Universal Forwarder to forward JBoss logs to a Splunk server. Here's an example Ansible playbook to achieve this:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder for JBoss log forwarding
  hosts: your_forwarder_hosts
  tasks:
    - name: Download and Install Splunk Universal Forwarder
      get_url:
        url: https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/{{ splunk_version }}/linux/splunk-{{ splunk_version }}-Linux-x86_64.tgz
        dest: /tmp/splunk.tgz
      become: yes

    - name: Extract Splunk Universal Forwarder
      ansible.builtin.unarchive:
        src: /tmp/splunk.tgz
        dest: /opt
        remote_src: yes
      become: yes

    - name: Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder
      template:
        src: splunk_inputs.conf.j2
        dest: /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
      become: yes

    - name: Start Splunk Universal Forwarder
      command: /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt
      async: 600
      poll: 0
      become: yes

    - name: Monitor JBoss log file
      command: /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log -sourcetype <your_sourcetype> -index <your_index_name>
      become: yes

    - name: Restart Splunk Universal Forwarder
      command: /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
      become: yes
```

Make sure to replace the following placeholders in the playbook with your specific values:

- `your_forwarder_hosts`: Replace this with the hostname or IP address of the machine where you want to install the Splunk Universal Forwarder.
- `splunk_version`: Specify the version of Splunk Universal Forwarder you want to download.
- `<your_sourcetype>`: Replace this with the desired sourcetype for your JBoss logs.
- `<your_index_name>`: Replace this with the name of the index where you want to store this data in Splunk.

Additionally, you may need to create a Jinja2 template file `splunk_inputs.conf.j2` with the contents for the `inputs.conf` file to monitor the JBoss log. Here's an example template:

```ini
[monitor:///opt/jboss/standalone/log/server.log]
disabled = false
index = <your_index_name>
sourcetype = <your_sourcetype>
```

After creating the playbook and template file, you can run the Ansible playbook with the `ansible-playbook` command to configure the Splunk Universal Forwarder on the specified hosts.
