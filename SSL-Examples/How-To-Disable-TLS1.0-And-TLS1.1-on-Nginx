To disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in Nginx, you'll need to modify the server configuration file. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. Locate the Nginx configuration file for your website. It is typically named `nginx.conf` or located in the `/etc/nginx/` directory.

2. Open the configuration file in a text editor.

3. Locate the `ssl_protocols` directive. It specifies the SSL/TLS protocols that Nginx will support.

4. Modify the `ssl_protocols` directive to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Remove the `TLSv1` and `TLSv1.1` entries from the directive and include only the more secure protocols. For example, your updated `ssl_protocols` directive may look like this:

   ```
   ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
   ```

   This configuration ensures that Nginx only supports TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, which are more secure.

5. Save the configuration file.

6. Verify the Nginx configuration for any syntax errors. Run the following command:

   ```
   nginx -t
   ```

   If there are no errors, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, fix the errors and run the command again.

7. Restart the Nginx service to apply the changes. The command to restart the service depends on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

   ```
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

After completing these steps, Nginx should no longer support TLS 1.0 and 1.1, ensuring that only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are allowed for secure communication.
