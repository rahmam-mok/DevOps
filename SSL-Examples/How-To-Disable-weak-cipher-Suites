To determine which cipher suites are weak in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) and remove them, you can follow these general steps:

1. Make sure you have OpenSSL installed on your system. OpenSSL provides the tools needed for cipher suite analysis.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to test the available cipher suites:

   ```
   openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL' | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq
   ```

   This command will list all the available cipher suites.

3. Analyze the output and identify the weak cipher suites that you want to remove. Weak cipher suites are typically those using outdated algorithms or offering weak encryption.

4. Open the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`) in a text editor.

5. Look for the SSL/TLS configuration section. It may include lines like `SSLCipherSuite` or `SSLProtocol`.

6. Edit the `SSLCipherSuite` directive and remove the weak cipher suites from the list. Replace them with stronger cipher suites that are considered secure.

   For example, if you want to remove the weak cipher suites using DES encryption, you can change the directive to something like:

   ```
   SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!EXPORT:!LOW
   ```

   This configuration allows only cipher suites with high security levels and excludes the weak ones.

7. Save the configuration file.

8. Restart the Apache service to apply the changes. The command to restart the service depends on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

After completing these steps, Apache HTTP Server should only support the stronger cipher suites that you have specified, removing the weak ones from the configuration.
