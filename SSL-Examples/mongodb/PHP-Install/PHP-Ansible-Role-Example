#To create an Ansible role that parameterizes the PHP version and installs PHP 7.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8), you can follow these steps:

1. Create the role directory structure:
ansible-galaxy init install_php

2. Update the install_php/defaults/main.yml file with the default values and variables:

---
php_version: "7.4"

3. Modify the install_php/tasks/main.yml file with the installation tasks:

---
- name: Enable EPEL repository
  yum:
    name: epel-release
    state: present

- name: Install PHP packages
  yum:
    name: "php{{ php_version }}-{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - php
    - php-cli
    - php-common
    - php-devel
    - php-json
    - php-opcache
    - php-readline
    - php-xml

- name: Install required dependencies
  yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - gcc
    - pcre-devel
    - zlib-devel


4. Update the install_php/meta/main.yml file with the role metadata:
---
galaxy_info:
  role_name: install_php
  author: Your Name
  description: Role to install PHP on RHEL 8
  min_ansible_version: 2.10


5. Now, you can use this role in your playbook. Create a playbook file (e.g., install_php.yml) with the following content:


---
- name: Install PHP on RHEL 8
  hosts: your_host_name
  become: yes

  roles:
    - install_php


Replace your_host_name with the target host or group of hosts where you want to install PHP 7.4.
6. Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command:


ansible-playbook install_php.yml --extra-vars "php_version=7.4"


ou can specify the desired PHP version using the --extra-vars flag when running the playbook. For example, to install PHP version 7.4, use --extra-vars "php_version=7.4". If you want to install a different PHP version, simply update the php_version value accordingly.
