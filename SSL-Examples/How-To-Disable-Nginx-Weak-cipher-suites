To determine which cipher suites are weak in Nginx and remove them, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have OpenSSL installed on your system. OpenSSL provides the tools needed for cipher suite analysis.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to test the available cipher suites:

   ```
   openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL' | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq
   ```

   This command will list all the available cipher suites.

3. Analyze the output and identify the weak cipher suites that you want to remove. Weak cipher suites are typically those using outdated algorithms or offering weak encryption.

4. Open your Nginx configuration file for the website in a text editor. The configuration file is usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

5. Locate the `ssl_ciphers` directive in your Nginx configuration file. This directive specifies the allowed cipher suites.

6. Edit the `ssl_ciphers` directive and remove the weak cipher suites from the list. Replace them with stronger cipher suites that are considered secure.

   For example, if you want to remove the weak cipher suites using DES encryption, you can change the directive to something like:

   ```
   ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!EXPORT:!LOW;
   ```

   This configuration allows only cipher suites with high security levels and excludes the weak ones.

7. Save the configuration file.

8. Verify the Nginx configuration for any syntax errors. Run the following command:

   ```
   nginx -t
   ```

   If there are no errors, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, fix the errors and run the command again.

9. Restart the Nginx service to apply the changes. The command to restart the service depends on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

   ```
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

After completing these steps, Nginx will only support the stronger cipher suites that you have specified, removing the weak ones from the configuration.
