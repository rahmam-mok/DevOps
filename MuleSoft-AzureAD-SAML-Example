To configure SAML authentication for MuleSoft’s Anypoint Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), follow the steps below:

1. Prerequisites

	•	Administrative access to Azure AD and Anypoint Platform.
	•	A verified domain in Azure AD.
	•	Access to the Azure AD SAML metadata and Anypoint SAML configuration.

2. Configure Azure AD as the Identity Provider

Step 1: Create an Enterprise Application

	1.	Log in to the Azure Portal.
	2.	Navigate to Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications.
	3.	Click + New Application > Create Your Own Application.
	•	Name it (e.g., MuleSoft SAML Integration).
	•	Choose Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery.
	•	Click Create.

Step 2: Set Up Single Sign-On (SSO)

	1.	In your new application, go to the Single sign-on section.
	2.	Select SAML as the single sign-on method.

Step 3: Configure the Basic SAML Configuration

	1.	Click Edit under Basic SAML Configuration.
	2.	Fill out the following fields:
	•	Identifier (Entity ID): https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/saml
	•	Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL):
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/sso/saml
	•	Sign on URL: Leave blank (optional).
	3.	Save the configuration.

Step 4: Download Azure AD SAML Metadata

	1.	In the SAML Signing Certificate section, download the Federation Metadata XML.
	2.	This file will be uploaded to Anypoint Platform.

3. Configure SAML in Anypoint Platform

Step 1: Enable SAML in Anypoint

	1.	Log in to Anypoint Platform as an admin.
	2.	Navigate to Access Management > Organization.
	3.	Select the Identity Management tab and click Configure SAML.

Step 2: Upload Azure AD Metadata

	1.	Upload the Federation Metadata XML file downloaded from Azure AD.
	2.	Configure the following:
	•	Entity ID: https://sts.windows.net/<your-tenant-id>/
	•	Single Sign-On URL: Found in Azure under Basic SAML Configuration.

Step 3: Save and Test Configuration

	1.	Click Save to enable SAML for your organization.
	2.	Test the integration:
	•	Log out of Anypoint.
	•	Attempt to log in using your SSO credentials.
	•	Verify that you’re redirected to Azure AD for authentication.

4. Map Attributes and Claims in Azure AD

	1.	In Azure AD, navigate to Single Sign-On > Attributes & Claims.
	2.	Ensure the following attributes are configured:
	•	Unique User Identifier (Name ID): Set to user.userprincipalname or user.mail.
	•	Additional Claims:
	•	email → user.mail
	•	firstName → user.givenname
	•	lastName → user.surname

5. (Optional) Role Mapping

If role-based access control is needed in MuleSoft:
	1.	Use custom claims in Azure AD to map roles.
	2.	Pass roles in the SAML assertion to Anypoint.
	3.	In Anypoint, navigate to Access Management > Roles, and assign roles based on these claims.

6. Troubleshooting Tips

	•	Ensure Entity ID and Reply URL are correct and match in both systems.
	•	Verify that time synchronization (NTP) is set up on both Anypoint and Azure AD to avoid token expiration issues.
	•	Check the SAML logs in Azure AD and Anypoint for errors.
