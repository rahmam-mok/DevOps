To install Nagios on a RHEL 8 server, secure it with an existing SSL certificate, and configure Nagios to authenticate users with an existing Active Directory, you can follow these steps using Ansible:

### Step 1: Install Nagios

Create an Ansible playbook to install Nagios on the RHEL 8 server. You can use the playbook mentioned in the previous responses for installing Nagios.

### Step 2: Configure SSL for Nagios

Assuming you have an existing SSL certificate and key, you can configure Nagios to use the certificate for secure HTTPS access. Here's how you can do it using Ansible:

1. **Copy SSL Certificate and Key**:

   Use Ansible to copy your SSL certificate and key to the Nagios server. Replace `your_certificate.crt` and `your_certificate.key` with the actual paths of your certificate and key files:

   ```yaml
   - name: Copy SSL Certificate and Key
     hosts: your_rhel_server
     become: yes

     tasks:
       - name: Copy SSL Certificate
         copy:
           src: /path/to/your_certificate.crt
           dest: /etc/ssl/certs/your_certificate.crt

       - name: Copy SSL Key
         copy:
           src: /path/to/your_certificate.key
           dest: /etc/ssl/private/your_certificate.key
   ```

2. **Configure Nagios to Use SSL**:

   You'll need to configure the Nagios web server (usually Apache) to use the SSL certificate. This may involve editing the Apache configuration files for Nagios. Here's a basic Ansible task to enable SSL in the Apache configuration:

   ```yaml
   - name: Enable SSL in Apache
     hosts: your_rhel_server
     become: yes

     tasks:
       - name: Enable SSL in Apache
         template:
           src: enable_ssl.conf.j2
           dest: /etc/httpd/conf.d/enable_ssl.conf
         notify: Restart Apache
   ```

   Create an Apache configuration template (e.g., `enable_ssl.conf.j2`) to enable SSL.

### Step 3: Configure Active Directory Authentication for Nagios

To configure user authentication for Nagios using your existing Active Directory (AD), you can use LDAP for this purpose. Here's a high-level guide on how to do it using Ansible:

1. **Install Required Packages**:

   Use Ansible to install the necessary LDAP client packages on your Nagios server:

   ```yaml
   - name: Install LDAP client packages
     hosts: your_rhel_server
     become: yes

     tasks:
       - name: Install LDAP client packages
         package:
           name: "{{ item }}"
           state: present
         loop:
           - openldap-clients
           - nss-pam-ldapd
   ```

2. **Configure LDAP Client**:

   Configure the LDAP client to connect to your AD server. Replace `your_ad_server` and `your_base_dn` with your AD server details:

   ```yaml
   - name: Configure LDAP Client
     hosts: your_rhel_server
     become: yes

     tasks:
       - name: Configure LDAP Client
         template:
           src: ldap.conf.j2
           dest: /etc/openldap/ldap.conf
   ```

   Create an LDAP configuration template (e.g., `ldap.conf.j2`) to specify your LDAP server settings.

3. **Create LDAP User and Group Configuration**:

   Create an LDAP user and group configuration file (e.g., `ldap_users_and_groups.cfg`) for Nagios. This involves defining the AD groups allowed to access Nagios.

4. **Restart LDAP Client Service**:

   Ensure that the LDAP client service is running with the updated configuration:

   ```yaml
   - name: Restart LDAP Client
     hosts: your_rhel_server
     become: yes

     service:
       name: nslcd
       state: restarted
   ```

### Step 4: Integrate LDAP Authentication with Nagios

You'll need to integrate the LDAP authentication configuration you've created with Nagios. This usually involves modifying the Nagios configuration files to enable LDAP-based authentication.

After completing these steps, your Nagios server should be configured to use your existing SSL certificate for HTTPS access and authenticate users against your Active Directory. Make sure to adapt the playbooks and configurations to your specific environment and security requirements, and test thoroughly.
