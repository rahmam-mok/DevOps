Configuring Nagios Core for Active Directory (AD) authentication involves several steps. Here's a general guide to help you set it up:

**1. Install Required Packages:**
   - Ensure that the `nagios` package is installed on your Nagios Core server.

**2. Install Apache with AuthLDAP:**
   - Install Apache with LDAP support:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-authnz-external
     ```

**3. Configure Apache:**
   - Edit the Apache configuration file, typically located at `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default` or a similar path.
   - Add the following lines to set up LDAP authentication:
     ```apache
     <Location "/nagios/">
         AuthType Basic
         AuthName "Restricted Access"
         AuthBasicProvider ldap
         AuthLDAPURL "ldap://your.ad.server/dc=domain,dc=com?sAMAccountName"
         AuthLDAPBindDN "yourbinduser@domain.com"
         AuthLDAPBindPassword "yourbindpassword"
         Require valid-user
     </Location>
     ```
   - Modify the `AuthLDAPURL`, `AuthLDAPBindDN`, and `AuthLDAPBindPassword` parameters with your AD server details.

**4. Configure Nagios:**
   - Update the Nagios Apache configuration to use the same LDAP authentication:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nagios/apache2.conf
     ```
     Add the following lines:
     ```apache
     ScriptAlias /nagios/cgi-bin "/usr/local/nagios/sbin"
     
     <Directory "/usr/local/nagios/sbin">
         AuthType Basic
         AuthName "Restricted Access"
         AuthBasicProvider ldap
         AuthLDAPURL "ldap://your.ad.server/dc=domain,dc=com?sAMAccountName"
         AuthLDAPBindDN "yourbinduser@domain.com"
         AuthLDAPBindPassword "yourbindpassword"
         Require valid-user
     </Directory>
     ```

**5. Restart Services:**
   - Restart Apache:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```

**6. Test Authentication:**
   - Try accessing Nagios through a web browser. You should be prompted for AD credentials.

**Note:**
   - Ensure that your Nagios server can reach the AD server, and necessary firewall rules are in place.
   - Modify LDAP parameters according to your AD server configuration.
   - Consider securing sensitive information like bind credentials.
   - The paths and configuration details may vary based on your Linux distribution and Nagios version.

Always refer to the official documentation for your specific Nagios Core version and Apache version, as configurations might differ slightly.
