The `ldap.conf.j2` template should contain the LDAP client configuration settings necessary to connect to your Active Directory (AD) server for authentication. Below is a basic example of what your `ldap.conf.j2` template might look like:

```ini
URI ldaps://your_ad_server:636/
BASE {{ ldap_base_dn }}
TLS_REQCERT allow

# Use a distinguished name (DN) to bind to the AD server.
# The DN should have sufficient permissions to perform LDAP searches.
# Replace 'your_bind_dn' and 'your_bind_password' with appropriate values.
BINDDN "CN=YourBindUser,OU=ServiceAccounts,DC=example,DC=com"
BINDPW "YourBindUserPassword"

# The following settings are required for Active Directory.
# You may need to adjust them based on your AD server's configuration.
PAM_LOGIN_ATTRIBUTE sAMAccountName
PAM_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE memberOf
PAM_GROUPDN "CN=YourNagiosUsers,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com"

# Configure the user and group search bases.
# Replace 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com' and 'ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com' with your AD organization structure.
BASE   ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
GROUP  ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com

# Enable TLS/SSL
TLS_CACERT /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
TLS_REQCERT allow

# LDAP search timeout (in seconds)
TIMEOUT 15
```

In this template:

- `URI`: Replace `your_ad_server` with the URI of your AD server, including the protocol (ldaps for LDAP over SSL).
- `BASE`: You should define the search base using the `ldap_base_dn` variable, which should be passed when applying the template.
- `BINDDN` and `BINDPW`: These should be set to a user with sufficient permissions to perform LDAP searches. Make sure to replace `YourBindUser` and `YourBindUserPassword` with the appropriate values.
- `PAM_LOGIN_ATTRIBUTE`, `PAM_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE`, and `PAM_GROUPDN`: These settings are specific to AD and may need to be adjusted based on your AD configuration.
- `BASE` and `GROUP`: These settings specify the LDAP search bases for users and groups. Modify them to match your AD structure.
- `TLS_CACERT` and `TLS_REQCERT`: These settings enable SSL/TLS and specify the path to the certificate authority's (CA) certificate file.

You will need to replace `example.com` and other placeholder values with your actual AD server details and organizational structure. Ensure that the LDAP client can establish a secure connection to your AD server, and that the user specified in `BINDDN` has the necessary permissions for LDAP queries.

When applying the template in your Ansible playbook, make sure to pass the `ldap_base_dn` variable with the actual LDAP base DN specific to your AD environment.
