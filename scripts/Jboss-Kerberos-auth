Configuring Kerberos authentication with AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and two JBoss servers involves several steps. This setup assumes that you have a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos, like Active Directory, and two JBoss servers behind an AWS ELB. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Ensure you have a functioning KDC, typically Active Directory.
   - Deploy two JBoss servers and your application.
   - Make sure you have Kerberos client utilities installed on your JBoss servers.

2. **Create Service Principal Names (SPNs)**:
   - Create Service Principal Names (SPNs) for your JBoss servers. These SPNs must match the DNS names used to access your application.
     ```
     setspn -s HTTP/your-elb-dns-name your-jboss-server1
     setspn -s HTTP/your-elb-dns-name your-jboss-server2
     ```

3. **Generate Keytab Files**:
   - Generate keytab files for each JBoss server using the `ktpass` or `ktutil` command. These keytab files will be used for server authentication.
     ```
     ktpass -princ HTTP/your-elb-dns-name@YOUR-REALM -mapuser your-jboss-server1 -pass your-password -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL -out jboss1.keytab
     ktpass -princ HTTP/your-elb-dns-name@YOUR-REALM -mapuser your-jboss-server2 -pass your-password -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL -out jboss2.keytab
     ```

4. **Copy Keytab Files**:
   - Copy the keytab files (`jboss1.keytab` and `jboss2.keytab`) to your JBoss servers and place them in a secure directory.

5. **Configure JBoss for Kerberos**:
   - Edit your JBoss server configuration (`standalone.xml`) to enable Kerberos authentication. Specify the path to the keytab files and the realm.

6. **Configure ELB for TCP/UDP Pass-through**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, configure your ELB listener to use TCP/UDP and direct traffic to the backend JBoss instances.

7. **Associate ELB with JBoss Instances**:
   - Ensure that your ELB is correctly associated with both JBoss instances.

8. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your domain's DNS records point to the ELB's DNS name.

9. **Test the Configuration**:
   - Use a client (e.g., a web browser) to access your application through the ELB's DNS name. Verify that Kerberos authentication works as expected.

10. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Implement proper logging and monitoring to track authentication and authorization events for troubleshooting and security purposes.

11. **Security Best Practices**:
    - Follow AWS and Kerberos security best practices, such as securing your keytab files, configuring appropriate IAM roles, and regularly rotating credentials.

12. **High Availability Considerations**:
    - Ensure that your architecture is designed for high availability, considering failover mechanisms for both JBoss servers and the KDC.

Remember to adapt these steps to your specific environment and requirements. Testing and thorough documentation are crucial for a successful Kerberos authentication setup with ELB and multiple JBoss servers.
