To add users or groups to the "Log on as a service" local security policy on a Windows Server using PowerShell, you can utilize the `secedit` command, just like in the previous response. Here's a PowerShell script to accomplish this:

```powershell
# Define the username or group name you want to add
$userOrGroupName = "YourUsernameOrGroupName"

# Create a security template file (.inf)
$infFilePath = "C:\Path\To\LogOnAsServicePolicy.inf"
@"
[Unicode]
Unicode=yes
[System Access]
SeServiceLogonRight = *$userOrGroupName
"@ | Out-File -FilePath $infFilePath -Encoding ASCII

# Apply the security template to the local security policy
secedit /configure /db C:\Windows\security\local.sdb /cfg $infFilePath /areas SecurityPolicy

# Clean up the temporary .inf file
Remove-Item $infFilePath

# Output a message indicating success
Write-Host "User or group '$userOrGroupName' added to 'Log on as a service' policy."
```

Make sure to replace `"YourUsernameOrGroupName"` with the actual username or group name you want to add to the "Log on as a service" policy.

Save the script to a `.ps1` file and then run it using an elevated PowerShell prompt on your Windows Server. It will create a temporary `.inf` file, apply the policy change, and then remove the temporary file.

Always exercise caution when modifying security policies, and ensure you have appropriate permissions to make these changes on your Windows Server.
