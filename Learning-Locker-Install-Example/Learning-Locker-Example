To create a Learning Locker user, install Learning Locker applications, install PM2 to manage Learning Locker application processes, and enable Learning Locker applications to start at boot time on Red Hat using Ansible, you'll need to structure your playbook accordingly. Here's how you can do it:Ansible Playbook Structure: Set up your playbook with a main playbook file and roles directory.Main Playbook (learning_locker_install.yml):---
- name: Install Learning Locker applications on Red Hat
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  become: true
  roles:
    - create_learning_locker_user
    - install_learning_locker
    - install_pm2
    - configure_startup
Roles Directory: Inside the roles directory, create four roles: create_learning_locker_user, install_learning_locker, install_pm2, and configure_startup.Create Learning Locker User Role (roles/create_learning_locker_user/tasks/main.yml):---
- name: Create Learning Locker user
  user:
    name: learninglocker
    shell: /bin/bash
    createhome: yes
Install Learning Locker Role (roles/install_learning_locker/tasks/main.yml):---
- name: Install required dependencies
  yum:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - epel-release
    - git
    # Add other dependencies as needed

- name: Clone Learning Locker repository
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/LearningLocker/learninglocker.git
    dest: /opt/learninglocker
    version: master
  become_user: learninglocker

- name: Install Node.js
  yum:
    name: nodejs
    state: present
  become_user: learninglocker

- name: Install MongoDB
  yum:
    name: mongodb-org
    state: present
  become_user: learninglocker

- name: Install required Node.js packages
  npm:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    global: yes
  loop:
    - grunt-cli
    # Add other required packages
  become_user: learninglocker
Install PM2 Role (roles/install_pm2/tasks/main.yml):---
- name: Install PM2
  npm:
    name: pm2
    global: yes
  become_user: learninglocker
Configure Startup Role (roles/configure_startup/tasks/main.yml):---
- name: Configure PM2 to start Learning Locker apps at boot
  command: pm2 startup systemd -u learninglocker --hp /home/learninglocker
  become_user: learninglocker

- name: Save PM2 configuration
  command: pm2 save
  become_user: learninglocker
Variables (Optional): Define variables in the respective role directories if needed for customization.Inventory File (inventory.yml): Define your target hosts in an inventory file.Running the Playbook:ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml learning_locker_install.yml
Adjust the playbook and roles as necessary for your environment and specific requirements. This playbook will create the Learning Locker user, install Learning Locker applications, install PM2 to manage application processes, and configure PM2 to start Learning Locker applications at boot time.
