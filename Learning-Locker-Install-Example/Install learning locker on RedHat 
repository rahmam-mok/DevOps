Create a playbook file (e.g., install_learning_locker.yml) with the following content:
Create a config.js file with the desired configuration for Learning Locker. You can use the default configuration as a starting point and modify it as needed. Place this file in the same directory as your playbook.
Replace your_host_name with the target host or group of hosts where you want to install Learning Locker.
Set the desired version for Learning Locker by updating the learning_locker_version variable.
Set the desired version of Node.js by updating the nodejs_version variable.
Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command:

ansible-playbook install_learning_locker.yml


This playbook installs Node.js and npm using the NodeSource repository, installs the required dependencies for Learning Locker, 
clones the Learning Locker repository, installs its dependencies using npm, copies the config.js file, builds the assets, and starts Learning Locker.
