Make sure to replace `nexus-proxy` with the appropriate Nexus proxy URL, and `nexus-registry` with the correct Nexus registry URL. Also, modify the Dockerfile and script as needed to incorporate any additional files, configurations, or build instructions specific to your requirements.

Please note that you may need to authenticate with the Nexus registry using appropriate credentials or API keys, depending on your Nexus setup.
