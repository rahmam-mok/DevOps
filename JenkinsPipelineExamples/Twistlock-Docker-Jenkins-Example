To print the Twistlock version installed, scan a Docker image using Twistlock, and generate HTML reports in a Jenkins pipeline, you can use the following pipeline code:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Print Twistlock Version') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def twistlockVersionCmd = """
                        twistcli --version
                    """
                    sh twistlockVersionCmd
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Build and Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                // Replace this with your Docker image build and push steps
                sh 'docker build -t your-image:tag .'
                sh 'docker push your-image:tag'
            }
        }

        stage('Scan Docker Image with Twistlock') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def twistlockCmd = """
                        twistcli images scan your-image:tag --output-file twistlock-scan-results.json
                    """
                    sh twistlockCmd
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Generate HTML Report') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def convertCmd = """
                        twistcli convert results twistlock-scan-results.json --output-file twistlock-scan-report.html
                    """
                    sh convertCmd
                }
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'twistlock-scan-report.html', allowEmptyArchive: true
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Add any post-build steps or notifications here
        }
    }
}
```

In this pipeline:

1. The first stage, "Print Twistlock Version," uses the `twistcli --version` command to print the Twistlock version installed on the Jenkins agent.

2. The second stage, "Build and Push Docker Image," builds and pushes the Docker image to your container registry. Adjust these steps as needed for your specific use case.

3. The third stage, "Scan Docker Image with Twistlock," scans the Docker image using the Twistlock CLI tool and saves the results in a JSON file (`twistlock-scan-results.json`).

4. The fourth stage, "Generate HTML Report," converts the JSON scan results into an HTML report using the `twistcli convert` command and archives it as an artifact.

5. You can customize the post-build steps for notifications, artifact management, or other actions as needed.

Ensure that you have the Twistlock CLI tool installed on the Jenkins agent where this pipeline is executed. Adjust the paths and file names as needed for your specific setup.
